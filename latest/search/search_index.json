There will be short 15 mins coffee breaks after each two hour training. During the full day trainings, there will also be an 1 hour break for lunch. Your feedback on this training is essential to improve it and provide you with additional examples and resources you might need during the FAIR learning materials development. Focusing on the co-creation process, in addition to the feedback form that is available on the course, there are many other ways to provide your feedback that will be presented during the training. Main interaction The main interaction with the participants will be via mics, chat, BBB quiz and interactive questions. A mini ice breaker is used to setup and test the interaction. Training purpose The main goal of the training is the practical implementation of the FAIR-by-Design learning materials methodology that has been developed by T2.3 and published in D2.2 . The methodology extends the backward instructional design process with the FAIR principles aiming to ensure that the learning materials will be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable from their conception and throughout their lifetime including updates, new versions, reuse, etc. The methodology is composed of 6 main steps that are iteratively repeated within a continuous improvement loop: Prepare develop FAIR skills that will augment the traditional instructional design skills. These include FAIR principles, Intellectual Property Rights, licensing, attribution, permanent identifiers (PIDs) and metadata. define the purpose, learning objectives and audience targets Discover identify existing learning materials assess the potential for their reuse Design define the syllabus and create the learning materials structure start a facilitators guide ensure interoperability by choosing open licenses Produce use open authoring tools and formats develop accessible content define metadata Publish deposit the learning content for learners and for instructors use PIDs define access rights and provide attribution guidelines enable feedback gathering list in relevant catalogues Verify go through a quality assurance (QA) process to verify FAIRness Continuous improvement should be implemented to ensure the learning materials are up-to-date and gathered internal and external input has been incorporated. This includes: analyze gathered feedback initiate a new version development when necessary Training objectives Upon successfully completing the training the attendees should be able to: Define FAIR learning objects Adapt and mix FAIR learning objects Identify licenses and attribute correspondingly Structure comprehensive learning materials Manage file formats and tools Define metadata using a schema Create and publish FAIR-by-Design learning materials Collaborate with other instructors Assess FAIR-ness of existing learning objects Materials The final formats of all materials are available on the Skill4EOSC learning platform within the FAIR-by-Design course. These include: presentation slides presentation notes related templates links for further reading self-assessment quizzes The course also includes the BBB room used for the training that will have the recordings from the training. In addition there is also an open forum where any enrolled trainee can ask a question or start a discussion. Finally, there is a feedback form that trainees are asked to fill out after the training so that the learning materials can be improved based on their feedback. During the live training the materials will be revealed on a day-by-day basis as the training progresses. To access the materials one must register on the learning platform and then self-enroll in the course. Finally, the course offers the possibility to obtain a FAIR Instructor badge once all course activities have been successfully completed. There are also sub-badges available for each stage of the FAIR-by-Design methodology. You don't need to be part of the live webinar to obtain the badge. Go through the learning material on your own and complete the requirements to get the badges. Training outline The overall training is divided into three days that focus on different steps of the FAIR-by-Design methodology. Day 1 focuses on the concepts of the Prepare, Discover and Design steps where you will need to ideate a new training and design its overall approach, content and structure. Day 2 will then take you through the development stage using different tools and format. And finally Day 3 showcases how to publish the ready materials so that they are FAIR for both learners and other instructors. In the end we have the final verification process and we discuss the continuous improvement process. The everyday life of a FAIR instructor What are the challenges instructors face while trying to make their developed learning materials FAIR?

Using these newly acquired skills, the instructor can then incorporate additional actions in the backward instructional design process in order to produce FAIR-by-design learning objects. Thus, becoming familiar with the FAIR principles and their implementation is an essential step in the Prepare stage of the FAIR-by-Design methodology. For the purposes of instructional design, the FAIR principles are applied to FAIR learning objects that represent the main digital objects used in learning/training activities. Learning Objectives Describe the FAIR-by-Design instructional design skills Summarize the FAIR guiding principles Define FAIR learning objects Determine FAIRness of learning objects Target Audience attendees of the FAIR-by-Design ToT live webinar Duration 35 mins Prerequisites none Learning Tools Training BBB room Browser Menti access or BBB quiz interaction FAIR Instructional Design Skills The skills required to start producing FAIR learning materials can be divided into two groups: FAIR oriented skills Expertise in advocacy and promotion of the FAIR guiding principles Expertise in curating and sharing FAIR data enabling Efficient application of the concept of metadata Choosing and implementing metadata schema with accompanying controlled vocabularies and ontologies Understanding the concept of storing and indexing digital objects Use of persistent identifiers (PIDs) for digital objects Use of repositories or learning management systems and storing platforms Legal expertise to be able to recognize, define and combine Intellectual Property Rights Licensing Attribution and citing of learning materials and other resources Traditional instructional design oriented skills Technical expertise in Different tools and formats used for creation and delivery of learning content and their interoperability Use of versioning during the creation and maintenance of different types of materials and resources Good communication, collaboration and research skills that will support the process of Co-creation, Sharing, Finding and reuse of learning materials, and Implementation of best practices and other related policies Learning experience design Ensuring effective learning by using the magic triangle of learning learning objectives training activities assessment methods FAIR guiding principles The \u2018 FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship \u2019 are published in Scientific Data in 2016. The main goal of this work is to provide guidelines on how to improve the F indability, A ccessibility, I nteroperability, and R eusability of digital objects. One of the main points is enabling FAIR not only from human, but also machine perspective, enabling automated actions on various digital objects. As digital learning materials are a type of digital objects, the general FAIR principles can also be applied to them. Note that the FAIR principles refer to three entities: the digital object the metadata (information that describes the digital object), and the infrastructure that stores or indexes the digital object (e.g. repository and catalogue). Metadata A set of data that describes and gives information about other data. Image taken from Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security website licensed under the CC BY NC 4.0 license . Findable To ensure a digital object is findable, the object should be accompanied with sufficiently detailed descriptive metadata a unique and persistent identifier (PID) such as a digital object identifier (DOI) should be used to point to the digital object. PID A persistent identifier (PI or PID) is a long-lasting reference to a document, file, web page, or other object. Accessible For the digital object to be accessible, the metadata and the object content should be understandable to both humans and machines, and the digital object should be stored in a trusted repository. clear authentication and authorization procedures should be defined and outlined although the access to the digital object can be restricted, the access metadata should always be open Authentication The process or action of verifying the identity of a user or process Authorization To give official permission for something to happen, or to give someone official permission to do something Interoperable The digital object is considered interoperable if the metadata follows a commonly accepted metadata schema combined with agreed-upon controlled vocabularies formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language(s) and format(s) are used for the digital object representation Controlled vocabulary A carefully selected list of words and phrases, which are used to tag units of information Reusable To be reusable a digital object should have a clear usage license accurate information on provenance. License A formal permission to do something or use some material within the limits established in its text. Provenance A record of ownership of a work of art or an antique, used as a guide to authenticity or quality More information about the FAIR principles and the general FAIRification process can be found on the GOFAIR website . FAIR Learning Objects When applying the FAIR guiding principles to learning materials, there are several aspects that need to be considered. Perspective Are the learning materials FAIR from a learner perspective or from the trainer/instructor perspective, or both? Using the FAIR-by-design methodology we aim to make the learning materials FAIR from both perspectives. This means that we aim to make the learning materials FAIR for both learners and other trainers and instructional designers. Granularity What is the level of granularity when applying the FAIR principles? Should the course be FAIR as a whole, or should each course module be FAIR on its own? The highest granularity level where we can apply the FAIR principles is the level of the learning object. Aggregation levels of learning materials FAIR learning object Any FAIR digital resource that supports learning developed around a single learning objective We define a FAIR learning object as any FAIR digital resource that supports learning developed around a single learning objective. At the very core of this approach is the idea that the learning object, accompanied with suitable descriptive metadata, can be used as a common building block for the development of more complex learning content by reusing it, re-purposing it, and potentially revising it. The best practice is to define a learning object as a package of: concrete learning outcome lesson plan lesson content one or more activities assessment facilitation guide. Characteristics of FAIR learning objects Findable \u2013 the learning object is the lowest hierarchical level of findability of learning materials in the EOSC ecosystem and is thus the lowest hierarchical level that can be described with metadata and catalogued Accessible \u2013 the full scope (content, tools and implementation resources) of the learning object should be accessible to both learning producers and consumers in the EOSC ecosystem Interoperable \u2013 with a well-chosen scope (content, tools and implementation resources), the learning object can be consumed on multiple platforms Re-usable \u2013 each learning object can be put in a wider context based on the specific learning requirements of a particular aggregate course, unit or module in the EOSC ecosystem. In summary: Learning objects are digital Learning objects contain learning content and information on tools and implementation resources Learning objects have an explicit learning objective Learning objects tend to be, but are not necessarily, small or granular in nature Learning objects tend to be, but are not necessarily, disassociated from context Learning objects are stored in a repository Learning objects are described using a metadata specification Learning objects are findable by searching a catalogue Learning objects are interoperable in that they can be used in multiple learning environments Learning objects are reusable by both other instructors and learners Learning objects can be repurposed for different learning contexts Learning object are composable into aggregates. Assessing FAIRness of learning materials Take the time to do a short exercise that aims to explore the understanding of the FAIR learning objects characteristics. For each of the provided examples of learning materials, one should individually decide whether they are F+A+I+R from learners and from trainers/instructional designers perspective. Example learning materials: https://opensciency.github.io/sprint-content/ and https://zenodo.org/record/7662732 https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/covid-19-data-portal/#vf-tabs__section--overview https://www.markdownguide.org/ As strict definitions are still lacking while doing this assessment, the FAIRness is assessed based on the general understanding of the concepts of FAIR and learning objects. Thus, all opinions are valid as long as they relate to the listed FAIR learning objects objective. Summary It is important to understand that there are different levels of FAIRness depending on how the main idea of the FAIR guiding principles is translated into a specific discipline such as the instructional design of learning materials. It is up to you to decide if you will implement the bare minimum or you will strive to go a step beyond and make your materials not only FAIR but also Open Educational Resources (OER) that will be available to all at no cost. In this training, we take the later approach where when putting together all showcases and examples you will end up with creating not only FAIR but also open learning objects. Think about: What information is missing to make the material FAIR? On what granularity level have you assessed the FAIRness? What type of detailed information is needed so that you can perform a real FAIR assessment? Suggested Reading Wilkinson, M., Dumontier, M., Aalbersberg, I. et al.

In essence, metadata consists of structured information that describes, explains and locates a resource. The main purpose of the (meta)data about the learning resource is to enable cataloguing and discovery by providing a standard means to report on: WHO created the resource WHAT is the content of the resource WHEN was the resource created WHERE is the location of the resource WHY the data was resource Example metadata for an image Using this information a learner or instructor should be able to: Search and retrieve the information about a learning resource Determine if the learning resource meets certain learning requirements Discover how to acquire and use the learning resource RDA Minimal Metadata for Learning Resources The RDA Education And Training On Handling Of Research Data Interest Group has defined a minimal metadata set for learning resources that has become a de facto standard for describing FAIR learning materials. The following table describes the minimal metadata set elements and their definitions: Element Name Definition Title The human readable name of the resource. Abstract / Description A brief synopsis about or description of the learning resource Author(s) Name of entity(ies) authoring the resource Primary Language Language in which the resource was originally published or made available Keyword(s) Keywords or tags used to describe the resource License A license document that applies to this content, typically indicated by URL Version Date Version date for the most recently published or broadcast resource URL to Resource URL that resolves to the learning resource or to a \"landing page\" for the resource that contains important contextual information including the direct resolvable link to the resource, if applicable. Resource URL Type Designation of the identifier scheme used for the resource URL, e.g., DOI, ARK, Handle Target Group (Audience) Principal users(s) for which the resource was designed Learning Resource Type The predominant type or kind that characterizes the learning resource Learning Outcome Descriptions of what knowledge, skills or abilities a learner should acquire on completion of the resource Access Cost Choice stating whether or not there is a fee for use of the resource (yes, no, maybe) Expertise (Skill) Level Target skill level in the topic being taught; example values include beginner, intermediate, advanced This table is taken from RDA Minimal Metadata for Learning Resources by Hoebelheinrich, Nancy J; Biernacka, Katarzyna; Brazas, Michelle; Castro, Leyla Jael; Fiore, Nicola; Hellstr\u00f6m, Margareta; Lazzeri, Emma; Leenarts, Ellen; Martinez Lavanchy, Paula Maria; Newbold, Elizabeth; Nurnberger, Amy; Plomp, Esther; Vaira, Lucia; van Gelder, Celia W G; Whyte, Angus licensed under the CC BY 4.0 license . These elements need to be standardized so that they are useful when used in practice. This is done by defining a metadata schema that describes the structure of the metadata elements. The metadata schema defines the standards for describing the metadata elements. The metadata schema for learning resources that also defines the type of each element, the allowed values, and constraints is available on the RDA website: RDA Minimal Metadata for Learning Resources Professional and Informal Education Examples Controlled Vocabularies Some of the fields in the proposed RDA metadata schema are based on fixed or suggested controlled vocabularies (CV). The use of controlled vocabularies is to help humans and machines categorize the information while helping to reduce duplication and errors. In essence, controlled vocabularies should be used for any metadata elements with predefined value(s), where in the vocabulary is presented as a list of prescribed items. Such examples are Access Cost with possible values of Y, N and Maybe Primary Language that can be a two letter code from the ISO 639-1:2002 codeset Note that in many cases controlled vocabularies are suggested, but at this stage they are not strictly defined. Later on during this training, you will learn how and where to define the metadata for your learning resources. Learning materials repositories The learning materials need to be stored in a learning repository so that they are made available to others. As the two perspective on learning materials (learners and instructors) have different needs regarding the type and content of the learning materials, to ensure FAIRness for both perspective the learning materials should be stored in two separate repositories: training repository that hosts editable learning materials for instructors learning repository that stores final learning materials to be consumed by learners. In Skills4EOSC the suggested choices for the repositories are as follows: learning materials for instructors should be stored on Zenodo (from GitHub) learning materials for learners should be stored on the Skills4EOSC learning platform Persistent Identifiers A persistent identifier (PID) is a type of metadata. Its purpose is to uniquely tag a digital object and ensure that this tag is not going to change over time (remains persistent). Using a PID one should be able to land on an accessible page with the listed digital object and its metadata. The actual access to the digital object from this page may be restricted. PIDs are machine readable and help distinguish between different materials different versions of the same material. Multiple kinds of PIDs exist such as DOI (digital object identifier), Handle (HNDL), ARK (Archival Resources Key). For the purposes of creating FAIR learning materials we will be using a Zenodo provided DOI to generate a PID for the trainers learning material kit and the internal IDs system of the Skills4EOSC learning platform for identifying learning resources for learners. Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Intellectual property refers to the creation of intellectual activity. Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) protects the interests of the creators and owners by providing them with rights over their creation. For the purposes of creation of learning materials, the copyright and related rights main branches of IPR are used. They are defined to protect literary and artistic creations, performances, phonograms by defining the authors\u2019, owners\u2019, performers\u2019, producers\u2019 and broadcasters\u2019 rights. In some cases additional IPR branches might be involved. Copyright Original work can be protected by copyright law that grants the owner exclusive right to control certain rights such as reproduction. The copyright is owned jointly by all authors, or it may be owned by the employing institution. Any work that you create by default makes you or your institution/employer the copyright holder of it. Use of copyright protected work requires permission from the owner . Permission may not be required in the case of works licensed in the public domain and uses covered by Copyright Exceptions. Only the copyright holder is allowed to distribute whatever is created. If you want to transfer this right to other people as well, you can do that via a license. In absence of exceptions or limitations, one can reuse an existing work if it is licensed to the user or it is licensed to the public using a public license such as the Creative Commons (CC) licenses or Free-Libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS) licenses . Licensing The content in this section is adapted from: CC FAQ website licensed under the CC BY 4.0 license Creative Commons license Wikipage (2023, June 21) in Wikipedia licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0 A license allows you to define rights and obligations regarding the use of your work. One of the best sources of information for licensing reusable learning materials is Creative Commons . There are many available CC License options which are based on the four baseline rights. It is recommended that the least restrictive CC BY 4.0 license , requiring only that credit is given to the creator when reusing, is used when creating new learning materials. The ND right falls into the opposite extreme and is not recommended for FAIR learning materials licensing as it severely limits their reusability in adaptations. Public domain licensing (CC0) is also not recommended as different rules apply in different countries. The CC License Chooser tool helps authors share their work in a standardised way providing copyright licenses that enable sharing and reuse of the creative work under the chosen conditions. To apply a license all you have to do is indicate which CC license you are applying to your work. You should then check the terms of the chosen license and comply with the requirements therein. For an example, it is strongly recommended to include a link to the relevant CC license deed (e.g., https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0). Example is provided below: Except where otherwise noted, content on this site is licensed under a Commons Attribution 4.0 International License Activity Now is a good time to test out the License Chooser tool and compare licenses. In the Creative Commons Wiki page: Marking your work with a CC license there are numerous examples on how license can be applied to different document types. Throughout this training you will be able to practice combining and applying licenses. Attribution and Citing The right to attribution is a moral right of the authors that protects the personal relationship between the author and the created work even if the creator does not own the copyright. In other words, acknowledgement of the reused materials through attribution is always needed (even if it is not a requirement of the license, such as the public domain licenses). One condition that is required for all CC licenses is attribution. The ideal attribution follows the TASL approach: T itle - what is the name of the work A uthor - who allows you to use the work (name and link) S ource - where can the work be found (link added to title) L icense - how can the work be used (name and link to the license) If your work is a modification or adaptation of another work, indicate this and provide attribution to the creator of the original work. You should also include a link to the work you modified and indicate what license applies to that work. For work created by others that you are incorporating into your own work you want to make it easy for others to know who created what parts of the work using the TASL approach. For an example see the attribution in the previous section of this document. Attribution examples Creative Commons offer a wiki page with the Recommended practices for attribution . Some examples on attribution provided on the Creative Commons wiki page are: Image attribution \" Creative Commons 10th Birthday Celebration San Francisco \" by Timothy Vollmer is licensed under CC BY 4.0 Adapted image attribution \" Creative Commons 10th Birthday Celebration San Francisco \" by Timothy Vollmer is licensed under CC BY 4.0 / Cropped from original Text attribution This chapter is from \u201c You Don't Know JS Yet (2nd Edition) \u201d by Kyle Simpson .

Such is the case with Pixabay that offers royalty-free images where the suggested attribution style is: Image by AUTHOR(link) from Pixabay(link) At the current moment, the Pixabay license allows use of content: for free without attribution (although recommended) for modification and adaptation into new work Citing A citation allows authors to provide the source of any quotations, ideas, and information that they include in their own work based on the copyrighted works of other authors. However, in the case of using direct quotations with citing, it is essential that the amount of information referenced is very limited. In addition, it is recommended to quote works that were already made available to the public in a lawful way and, when possible, to provide the original source and the author's name. Depending on the country, the reproduction and communication of a protected work may be carried out for the sole purpose of illustration for teaching or scientific research, as long as the source, including the author's name, is indicated, unless this turns out to be impossible and to the extent justified by the non-commercial purpose to be achieved.

It is recommended that the least restrictive CC BY 4.0 license , requiring only that credit is given to the creator when reusing, is used when creating new learning materials. The ND right falls into the opposite extreme and is not recommended for FAIR learning materials licensing as it severely limits their reusability in adaptations. Public domain licensing (CC0) is also not recommended as different rules apply in different countries. The CC License Chooser tool helps authors share their work in a standardised way providing copyright licenses that enable sharing and reuse of the creative work under the chosen conditions. To apply a license all you have to do is indicate which CC license you are applying to your work. You should then check the terms of the chosen license and comply with the requirements therein.

For these purposes the unit focuses on sources of existing learning materials that can be reused, focusing on the needs of the trainings that are to be done within the Skills4EOSC project.

This exercise helps the designer understand what type and content of learning material would be best suited to achieving the learning objectives. Searching for readily available learning materials helps get inspired with the different ways of assessment and related learning materials. It boosts the process of instructional design that does not have to start from scratch but can reuse materials for achieving some of the identified learning objectives. As licenses determine the possibility of reuse, upon discovery of existing learning resources license identification must be carried out to ensure that the resource can be reused with attribution under the specified rules. Closed learning resource that do not allow reuse can be used only for inspiration and limited quoting and citation for illustrative purposes. Learning materials repositories Unfortunately, at this stage there is no straightforward way to find readily available and reusable learning materials related to the topics of Open Science and EOSC. This is not due to the lack of such resources, as there has been a great number of projects and activities that offer training. However, there is no one catalogue of learning resources for instructors that has been accepted in the community as the place to go to when searching for existing learning resources. Most of the existing catalogue are focused on the learners, not the instructors. This has led to the situation where these materials are now mostly found in general repositories making it difficult to search and filter. In this section we aim to provide a shortlist of links to repositories that should contain at least some learning materials on the topic of Open Science. Note however that this list is far from exhaustive and it does not include any discipline specific repositories. OER Repositories Identifying Open Educational Resources (OER) for reuse is always the best option as they are developed with reuse in mind. OER learning resources are stored in OER repositories. There are many OER repositories available, however their potential for reusing learning materials for the purposes of designing Open Science related courses is still very limited due to a number of reasons: most of the OER repositories are hosted by USA institutions most of the OER repositories store learning resources that are not related to Open Science there is no one search engine that searches through all available OER repositories This is a short list of some of the most popular OER repositories and catalogues at the moment with a link to the repository and a short description: DOAB (Directory of Open Access Books) - a discovery service for peer reviewed open access books and book publishers that indexes and provides access to high quality, open access, peer-reviewed books. MERLOT (Multimedia Educational Resources for Learning and Online Teaching) - a free and open online community of resources designed primarily for faculty, staff and students of higher education from around the world to share their learning materials and pedagogy. The MERLOT system provides access to curated online learning and support materials and content creation tools, led by an international community of educators, learners and researchers. OASIS (Openly Available Sources Integrated Search) - a search tool that aims to make the discovery of open content easier OER Commons - a public digital library of open educational resources.

FORRT (Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training) - provides a pedagogical infrastructure & didactic resources designed to recognize and support the teaching and mentoring of open and reproducible science offering FAIR teaching and mentoring resources and many others ... EOSC projects related training materials and catalogues Many EOSC projects have created their own learning platforms or even more general repositories with integrated catalogues where one can search for existing learning materials used for training within the projects: EOSC Training catalogue on the EOSC Marketplace EOSC Synergy learning platform EOSC Pillar RDM Training and Support catalogue NI4OS-Europe Training Platform EOSC-Nordic Training Library OpenAIRE Open Plato Elixir Training Platform Europeana - Discover Europe\u2019s digital cultural heritage and many others ... Note that the EOSC Training catalogue that is part of the EOSC Marketplace is planned to become the focal point for the discovery of these types of learning resources. This catalogue is however still under development, and at the moment only a handful of resources are available. General repositories and platforms The general repositories and platforms host all types of resources including learning material. Lately they have become an increasingly favorite location for hosting instructor facing learning materials. However searching within should be done with greater care as the filtering options are general and it is difficult to search for a specific learning resource type.

Another option is to use the images search in the Google engine together with the Tools -> Usage Rights -> Creative Commons Licenses. Discovering learning content related to Open Science It must be acknowledged that the Discovery step in the FAIR-by-Design methodology is one of the most complicated at this current stage due to the lack of clearly identified learning resources repositories and catalogues for learners and instructors materials. While this is expected to change with time, the initial landscaping already performed within Skills4EOSC is an excellent starting point. For the purposes of understanding the diversity of the existing learning materials that can be found try to perform the following exercise that aims to discover different learning materials related to the topic of Open Science: You have been tasked to develop a new course on the topic of Open Science for policy makers. You already went through step 1 of the backward instructional process and defined the essential information including learning objectives. Spend some time thinking how can you assess if someone has managed to reach the defined learning objectives? This should help you identify the main concepts that you need to cover in your courses and develop content and activities around. Now it is time to start searching through repositories and catalogues and find materials you could possibly reuse or be inspired with. Start from Zenodo with the \"open science training\" keywords notice the type Lesson available in the filter on the left the file type filter further allows you to choose different file formats bear in mind that the zip file type is typically associated with content developed on GitHub and this usually means editable content in an open format (usually md); for details on this refer to the Produce section. this is where you will find the currently very popular Opensciency learning materials . using the keyword \"course\" usually provides you with mostly lesson type resources, but sometimes the type other is also used for learning resources an example is Re:ERUA Open Science Fundamental Course Now try OSF search the filter here is not as sophisticated as in Zenodo, so you will need to play with adding keywords such as \"training\" or \"course\" look around and try to find something useful. notice what information you would like to see to help you with your search notice that some resources are available only to registered users this is where you will find the Open Science Course example take a look at the structure and the documents Lets try the OER repos/catalogues next try searching for \"open science\" in OASIS , OER commons and MERLOT notice that many results overlap across the different repos can you find something more specific such as a lesson plan, syllabus, or assignment? are you able to find a multimedia oriented materials such as a video, podcast, or similar? in OASIS you should be able to find a TED talk video on Open Science Now! in OER Commons you should be able to find the Open Goverment at NASA in MERLOT you should be able to find online course Open Science: Sharing Your Research with the World are you able to access the materials which are licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0? The next stop is FORTT and its Educational Nexus try to find an Open Science lesson plan here you should be able to get to the Lesson plan 4: Intro to Open Science lesson plan hosted on OSF note that there are links to other learning resources in the lesson plan The final stop is the EOSC training catalogue notice that there are resource types such as lesson plan, activity plan and assessment also note that the same resource can have multiple types you should be able to find the Toolkit for policy makers on Open Access and Open Science Now that you are armed and inspired with what you have managed to find, you are ready to proceed to the next stage Design. Summary The process of discovery of existing learning materials can not only help you reuse available high quality learning resources but also inspire you with different approaches to introducing the learning topic to the target audience. There is however no one magical catalogue or search platform that can be used during discovery. To the contrary, finding existing learning materials is a journey across catalogues and repositories that can be a painstaking, complicated and long process. Thus, ensure that you have planned enough time for this activity.

This exercise helps the designer understand what type and content of learning material would be best suited to achieving the learning objectives. Searching for readily available learning materials helps get inspired with the different ways of assessment and related learning materials. It boosts the process of instructional design that does not have to start from scratch but can reuse materials for achieving some of the identified learning objectives. As licenses determine the possibility of reuse, upon discovery of existing learning resources license identification must be carried out to ensure that the resource can be reused with attribution under the specified rules.

Most of the existing catalogue are focused on the learners, not the instructors. This has led to the situation where these materials are now mostly found in general repositories making it difficult to search and filter.

Using concept maps helps clarify the relationships among learning concepts when designing or redesigning your learning materials. The main goal of the concept map is to start outlining the specific components of your training, organize the components and make sure that they fit in with the defined learning objectives. It does not matter which type of concept map you will use (hierarchical, spider, flowchart, etc.), the main focus here is to flesh out the components that you would like to include in your materials. An example concept map for Open Science is presented in the image below. Open Science concept map based on a keyword co-occurrence network analysis in the The Uptake of Open Science: Mapping the Results of a Systematic Literature Review by Hanna Shmagun, Charles Oppenheim, Jangsup Shim and Jaesoo Kim available under CC BY license Activity Try building a concept map about your upcoming training. You can start with the most simple approach. Use the topic of the training as a core concept in the middle, and then just link the concepts you think are important to cover to it. With this you will get a star shaped concept map design, also known as the spider concept map. You can continue adding layers to the concept map by defining subconcepts of the defined concepts. Sometimes it is best if you do this exercise on a piece of paper as the process will follow your design thinking more naturally. If you want to work on a digital concept map you can use almost any tool for graphical modelling. An example is draw.io that offers several templates with different concepts maps design (you will find them in the category Maps when choosing to create a new diagram from template). Your final result may look simple or complicated. This depends on the focus of the training, the length of the training and the level of details that you want to represent. Another example is presented below. Open science elements based on UNESCO presentation of 17 February 2021 by RobbieIanMorrison provided under the CC BY 4.0 license Syllabus Once you have identified your learning concepts, the next step is to sequence them into an instructional sequence (agenda). This instructional sequence will become your blueprint for the organisation of the learning materials and the definition of the syllabus. In essence the blueprint takes the input from the creative concept map and organizes it into a more formal outline. Formally, we call this learning materials outline syllabus. Each syllabus should provide information regarding a number of elements (including the ones defined in the step 1 of the backward instructional design): clear, descriptive title description of the purpose or goal target audience prerequisites duration learning objectives agenda (instructional sequence) resources and materials certification information Remember that: The syllabus can present a higher level sequence outline, that can be later broken down into smaller subtopics if necessary. The topics sequence should be defined so that the concepts introduced early help with the ones encountered later. The defined agenda should not be very rigid thus preventing changing the sequence of topics or adding or deleting topics at a later stage. The syllabus is sent to the learners and should provide them with all necessary information to help them decide if they want to follow the training related to the learning materials. Syllabus Elements Within this training we recommend the development of a training syllabus that consists of two groups of information: typical syllabus information additional information related to the RDA minimal metadata schema The following is a list of all required syllabus fields : Clear descriptive Title of the training Type (Course/Workshop/Webinar) Date/Time: when it will be offered (available from date if it is self-paced) Location - where it will be available physical location URL link to resources (and virtual room if online) should lead to the learning Skills4EOSC platform Training Description - what is the main goal/purpose of this training Target audience: target audience description Expertise Level / Skill Level: Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced Primary Language: English Access Cost: N Prerequisites - if any Duration - total training duration Training objectives - list of specific training objectives Keywords - Keywords or tags used to describe the training Agenda: Training Schedule - Training Structure (time, topic) Resources and Materials - list with locations of available/required resources for the training Certification Information - if any Author(s) - Comma separated List of people involved in preparing the training (Name Surname) Trainer(s) - Comma separated list of people involved in delivering the training (Name Surname ORCID logo link) Contact information - how to reach out to training organizers License PID Accessibility Mission As syllabus is one of the required documents for the FAIR-by-Design learning materials, you must ensure that your syllabus contains all elements provided in this section. Only in this way you will ensure that your learning materials contain all necessary metadata information together with the traditional syllabus information that is provided. Activity Review the FAIR-by-Design Methodology for Learning Materials Training of Trainers syllabus that has been developed based on the provided template as a complete example. Think how you would change this example to adapt it so that it can become your own syllabus for the Open Science for policy makers training. Use the information you gathered and defined in the previous activities. Summary Building a concept map of your training is a creative way of organising your ideas and inspiration gathered from the discovery step. Armed with this knowledge you are able to define the concepts and sub-concepts that you need to provide learners with to ensure achieving their learning objectives. Once you have a more clear idea of the concepts you wish to cover and how they relate to each other, you are ready to create a high-level outline of the training, i.e. define the syllabus. To ensure that you have covered all essential information in your syllabus we provide a template that you can follow. Remember that the syllabus contains all of the information you need to share with the potential trainees. Thus, it should be shared with them when sending out the call for training.

Activity Try to develop your own hierarchical structure for the Open Science for Policy Makers course. Use the information you gathered in the Discovery step as inspiration keeping in mind its potential for reuse. Mark the learning objects or learning units that you can reuse from what you have already discovered. Licensing and Attribution Combining and Remixing CCs When reusing learning materials there is sometimes need to combine learning materials from different sources available under different licenses, i.e. combining. You may combine any CC-licensed content so long as you provide attribution and comply with the NonCommercial restriction if it applies. If you want to combine material in a way that results in the creation of an adaptation (i.e. a \u201cremix\u201d), then you must pay attention to the particular license that applies to the content you want to combine. adaptation A modification rises to the level of an adaptation under copyright law when the modified work is based on the prior work but manifests sufficient new creativity to be copyrightable. The licensing section in the Preparing FAIR Learning Objects learning unit is an example of such an adaptation of two materials that have been combined together and further adapted by editing the text. It is essential to understand that when reusing existing learning materials, one must ensure that the licenses of the included and adapted materials are compatible with each other. For these purposes, the CC license compatibility chart can be used. CC License Compatibility Chart by CC FAQ website licensed under the CC BY 4.0 license Another moral right is the right of integrity which provides the author with the right to object to any modifications of the work that can be considered as prejudicial to the authors\u2019 honour or reputation. Thus, even when reuse and modifications are permitted, they should be done in such a way that does not include a derogatory treatment of the work. Adapter's License If you make adaptations of material under a CC license (i.e. \u201cremix\u201d), the original CC license always applies to the material you are adapting even once adapted. The license you may choose for your own contribution (called your \u201cadapter\u2019s license\u201d) depends on which license applies to the original material. The chart below details the CC license(s) you may use as your adapter\u2019s license. When creating an adaptation of material provided under a license identified in the left column, you may license your contributions to the adaptation under one of the licenses indicated on the top row if the corresponding box is green. CC does not recommend using a license if the corresponding box is yellow, although doing so is technically permitted by the terms of the license. If you do, you should take additional care to mark the adaptation as involving multiple copyrights under different terms so that downstream users are aware of their obligations to comply with the licenses from all rights holders. Dark gray boxes indicate those licenses that you may not use as your adapter\u2019s license. CC license(s) you may use as your adapter\u2019s license in CC FAQ website licensed under the CC BY 4.0 license Licensing exercise You are preparing a new course on Open Science and have decided to combine some already available content (images or even whole learning units) and also create your own learning content (additional learning units). The content that you would like to reuse is: Your adaptation of Lesson 1 - What is Open Data from OpenSciency M1 - Open Science Ambassador Training from EURODOC slide 3 from Why open science? presentation by Sarah Jones slide 10 from Why open science? presentation by Sarah Jones slide 5 from Why open science? presentation by Sarah Jones combined with the badges image and text from Center for Open Science into a new adaptation The first thing you need to check is if reuse is allowed, i.e. check the licenses under which the content is released. If this is so, then you need to determine if it is allowed to combine together these contents. For the content that will be adapted, you need to check how the remix may be used. Finally, you need to decide on the license of your work. Attribution Do not forget that all reused material (with or without adaptation) needs to be attributed to the original author according to the TASL rules (or in another format if specified by the author). It is recommended that if a complete learning unit is reused to provide the attribution at the beginning of the unit. Same applies for reused parts of a learning unit (text only, or combination of text and images). The attribution of reused images and tables goes right under the content. As you continue to create your own learning content you will identify additional resources that you would like to reuse. As long as the resources have illustrative purpose only you don't need to double check the adapter license. But, you will need to provide attribution for all of them. Attribution should be provided in all places where the resource is reused (content, slides, activity description, etc.) Therefore, it you still have doubts about how to attribute a resource, revisit the attribution activity in the Preparing FAIR Learning Objects learning unit. Summary Once the syllabus is completed, a fine grained hierarchical structure can be defined clearly depicting the reused learning resources and the new learning content that needs to be created. Before starting with adaptation and design of the new learning content you need to ensure that you have followed the rules of CC licenses remixing and have defined a compatible adapters license. Finally, always keep in mind that you MUST attribute all of the reused resources (both adaptations and illustrations only).

To achieve this, not only the learning objectives, but all content, activities, assignments and assessments must be learner-centered. Learners perform best when they are engaged in authentic activities, collaborate with peers to share and deepen their understanding, and apply their existing skills to different contexts and new problems. Rich learning experiences can be supported by inquiry-based learning structures, such as projects and performance tasks thoughtfully interwoven direct instruction opportunities to practice and apply learning It is important that learners are given meaningful tasks that build on their prior knowledge together with a safe positive environment in which they can receive timely and helpful feedback. Units should be well structured so as to reduce the unnecessary cognitive load, and based on multiple modalities and tools for accessing information and expressing learning to support different types of learners. Learning Unit Plan To ensure rich learning experience it is imperative to develop a learning unit plan. This document incorporates all aspects that should lead to a high quality learning experience as it defines the plan on how to use teaching methods and the learning content together with activities to achieve the defined learning objectives. Note that an effective lesson plan for online trainees may not be the same to the one for traditional workshop settings. Formally, a unit plan refers to a detailed step-by-step guide for a trainer to understand what materials to give to students and how to provide them so students would accomplish their learning goals. There may be different detail levels of the learning unit plan: Detailed: a detailed plan that includes what will be the trainer step-by-step plan and learning activities. Semi-detailed: a semi-detailed plan is less complex and offers a general game plan of what will be covered in the unit. It is recommended that you follow the Hunter's model for developing a learning unit plan: Set the learning objectives These are lower level learning objectives for the particular learning unit. Combining all learning objectives from all units should lead to the high level learning objectives defined in the syllabus. Ensure these are clear and follow a logical order that is easy to understand and help identify meaningful concepts and ideas. Follow the Bloom's taxonomy again. Identify the needs of the target audience Make sure you are prepared to help learners along the way Plan your training material Create a list of all the resources. From stationary like a pen or paper to technology equipment like laptops, software, or gamified learning tools like apps or any website, all these can help you get the most out of what you intend to do. Present the outline of the unit - the Hook Throughout the training, the goal is to keep learners engaged. An outline can help them develop a context around the subject, letting them know what is coming next, and encourage them to relate to the learning materials at hand. Don\u2019t forget to draw relevant examples of events or develop creative activities that spark interest and attention. Instruct the lesson Follow the order and present the resources you need, but also make sure to involve the learners in this process. You may use as much multimedia as you want to facilitate engagement and give a wealth of examples learners can relate to easily \u2013 most important is to present the information in a meaningful way. Provide time to practice Once you finish your instruction, it\u2019s the learners\u2019 turn to take the lead. Ask them to show what they have learned through practice. For an example start with a guided practice \u2013 allowing learners to make sense of the information they have just received. Then you can follow up with a collaborative process \u2013 let them work in groups to explore main concepts. Finish with independent practice \u2013 giving each time to work on their own through an assignment. Wrap-up Do an overview of what has been discussed and what has been learned. Ask learners to tell you the key takeaways, identifying main ideas and conclusions. Give a preview of the next unit to prepare them. Evaluate Determine whether the learning objectives have been met, and ensure that learners understood what you taught through a small quiz, test, or exam. Reflection Did everything do as planned or something needs to be improved? Learning Unit Plan Development In a nutshell, the required information that you need to provide in your learning plan is: Unit Name Purpose of the unit Location Duration Number of attendees Learning objectives Plan including topic, duration, key points, teaching methods, activities and resources Assessment Certification Reflection Remember that although some parts of this information may seem repetitive with the overall syllabus, the plan is much more detailed and the repetition provides the much needed context for reuse. Method(s) When developing the plan you will need to think about the teaching methods that will be used during the training. One or more preferred teaching methods should be utilised during the training for maximum effect. Some typical teaching methods that can be employed are presented in the following image Image by edX from teach.com , \u00a9 2U Activity Analyse the Example Learning Plan that has been created for one of the learning units that are part of this training. Are you able to prepape a learning unit plan for the identified units in your Open Science training? Note that the development process is iterative. As you develop the content later on you might come back to the plan and make changes. Don't forget that larger changes might also affect the syllabus. Learning Content Once you have a plan, it is time to start developing the learning content. Remember to design the content so that it appeals learners with different modalities (verbal, audio, read/write, kinesthetic) including different multimedia. The learners notebook is the main learning content that you are aiming to introduce the learners to. The content of each learning unit notebook should include: brief introduction learning objectives target audience duration prerequisites learning tools content summary suggested reading Again, although some items may seem repetitive compared to the syllabus, bear in mind that this is done in order to improve reusability. In this way the learning unit can be reused as a stand alone package. Remember to add different types of media to the content, supporting an integrated multi-modal approach. For pure self-based learning the complete notebook should be enough to present all of the learning content in one place. However, for trainer led environments, usually a slide deck is also necessary so that the trainer can lead the trainees across the learning content and work with them through the activities. The slide deck should follow the stages of the HUNTER model : title slide introduction (trainers and trainees) Housekeeping information Learning Objectives Training Outline Training Topic information example guided activity Wrap up key takeaways final Q&A assessment information feedback gathering Activity details All activities that are planned to be performed with or by the learners as part of the learning unit plan should be described in enough details so that they can be executed by any trainer or facilitator no matter if they are part of the original instructional design team or not. They could be only tasked with training implementation, or they could be simply reusing the learning material. In addition, this additional documentation related to activity description can serve as a personal reminder long after the training has been completed and it allows for keeping notes on how the activity was implemented as well as any external community feedback. Based on the best practices, each activity should be described in a separate document that contains: activity name short description duration number of people it can be performed with goal materials instructions tips and tricks related sources comments This example of an activity description document related to one of the activities offered in this training can help you visualise the type of information that needs to be included for each activity. A set of well described and reusable activities can be found at the Session lab website . Another source of activities is 25 activities for making lecture-based training active . Assessment Thinking about how you can assess the learners obtained knowledge is part of step 2 of the backward instructional design process. Traditionally, there are many different types of assessments that can be performed, but the most typically used in professional training and certification is the quiz form. In general, quizzes can be used in a large variety of settings, providing opportunities for reflection, knowledge improvement with feedback or assessment. Although they can be setup as formative (after each learning unit) or summative (one exam quiz at the end), from the FAIR-by-design perspective, it is recommended that at least the questions that form the quiz are setup in a formative way, meaning each learning unit comes with a set of questions that are related to that particular learning unit. In this way, it is up to the instructor to setup the assessment: is it going to be multiple quizzes throughout or is it going to be one in the end. When designing the quiz questions one should go back to the Bloom's taxonomy introduced in 02 Preparing FAIR learning objects . This time however, you are interested in what type of quiz question can be used to assess the knowledge of a different level of the cognitive domain. This is presented in the table below. T/F MC MS LA SA FIB MAT ORD Create X Evaluate X X X X Analyze X X X Apply X X X X X Understand X X X X Remember X X X X X where T/F - True/False MC - multiple choice MS - multi-select LA - long answer SA - short answer FIB - fill in the blank MAT - Matching ORD - Ordering The easiest way to define the quiz questions in a reusable format is to use the GIFT quiz format that can then be imported in the Skills4EOSC learning platform (the other way around is also possible, export the questions created on the platform in GIFT for others to reuse). The provided Quiz GIFT Template contains examples of the different types of questions. Detailed instructions on how to write quiz questions in the GIFT format can be found on the Moodle site: GIFT format . You can use the GIFT Question Editor to validate or generate your own GIFT formatted quiz questions. Create a quiz Try to create a quiz that has at least 3 different questions of different types for one of the learning units of your Open Science course. Validate your quiz using the GIFT Question Editor . Assessment Strategy Once you have defined your quiz questions, the next step is to define the quiz strategy. This strategy can be defined separately for each quiz as a common strategy for all formative quizzes, or can be one strategy for the summative final exam In the first case, a separate strategy document needs to be developed for each learning unit, while for the later two options (recommended) the quiz strategy can be described in the main facilitation guide document (see next learning unit for more details). If each learning unit has its own quiz strategy then it should be provided together with the learning unit. The assessment strategy needs to describe the following items: how many questions should be used from the questions pool is there any weight that should be given to the questions questions order (random or specific) answers order quiz duration when the quiz starts and finishes how many times it can be taken grading method completion rules results publication guide Summary A complete learning unit consists of several parts: learning unit plan learning unit content optional slide deck or similar type of instructional material activities description assessment quiz and strategy Note that in the next stage, Prepare, you will train on how to create the content from scratch. At this point in the Design stage the goal is only to introduce you to the type of information that needs to be provided in each of the defined documents.

The content of each learning unit notebook should include: brief introduction learning objectives target audience duration prerequisites learning tools content summary suggested reading Again, although some items may seem repetitive compared to the syllabus, bear in mind that this is done in order to improve reusability. In this way the learning unit can be reused as a stand alone package. Remember to add different types of media to the content, supporting an integrated multi-modal approach. For pure self-based learning the complete notebook should be enough to present all of the learning content in one place.

Traditionally, there are many different types of assessments that can be performed, but the most typically used in professional training and certification is the quiz form. In general, quizzes can be used in a large variety of settings, providing opportunities for reflection, knowledge improvement with feedback or assessment. Although they can be setup as formative (after each learning unit) or summative (one exam quiz at the end), from the FAIR-by-design perspective, it is recommended that at least the questions that form the quiz are setup in a formative way, meaning each learning unit comes with a set of questions that are related to that particular learning unit. In this way, it is up to the instructor to setup the assessment: is it going to be multiple quizzes throughout or is it going to be one in the end. When designing the quiz questions one should go back to the Bloom's taxonomy introduced in 02 Preparing FAIR learning objects . This time however, you are interested in what type of quiz question can be used to assess the knowledge of a different level of the cognitive domain. This is presented in the table below.

It is also essential for high quality reusability of the learning materials by other trainers and/or instructional designers. The complete instructor kit consists of learning materials that are developed and used to support the learning process, but are not directly visible by learners. These include the following items: learning unit plan activity details quiz question banks quiz strategies facilitation guide feedback questions Most of the items were already introduced and discussed in 06 - Learning Unit Development . Here we will only focus on the last documents: the facilitation guide and the feedback questions. Facilitation Guide As the syllabus represents the learner's view of the learning materials, the facilitation guide is a document that represents the trainers view and aims to enable a smooth and efficient training. Thus the guide aims to help with the general activities regarding the organisation of the training, what needs to be done before, during and after the training, how to setup the training environment, prepare any props and materials, etc. A well-defined facilitation guide should include the following elements: what to do before during after the training where are all of the materials that should be used during the training digital materials location physical resources and equipment needed e.g. projector e.g. activity resources such as card decks etc. how to prepare the materials beforehand e.g. something needs to be written on flip charts how to prepare the learning environment room layout and any other specifics (e.g. name tags, sign-in sheet, etc.) in case of an online training this includes preparation of the virtual room, providing access, sending out or publishing reading materials, etc. In the case of a summative or common quiz strategy it can contain this information as well. For best visibility, the guide should also contain shortcuts to all activities planned. However, any specific details and notes should be available in the learning unit plan. Feedback questions At the end of the learning process you should gather feedback from the learners so that they can provide feedback on what worked well and what should be improved in the training and learning materials. For these purposes a set of feedback questions should be drafted. The feedback can be gathered by enabling the learners to answer the questions using different modalities: physically by filling out a feedback sheet digitally using a feedback form created on the learning platform or using some other survey system An example Training Evaluation form is presented in the next subsection. A similar evaluation form can be created using the feedback tool in the Skills4EOSC platform. Do not forget to set the following settings of the defined feedback used for training evaluation: availability from - to anonymous no multiple submissions show analysis page (for transparent review of the results) Training Evaluation Form In Skills4EOSC we strive to provide high quality training and continuous improve our training activities.

Machine-readable metadata To complete the full set of learning materials and abide by the FAIR principles that require that the metadata be both human and machine readable, the fields from the RDA minimal metadata schema need to be filled out in a machine-readable format. As this information has been stored in the syllabus, it is recommended that the machine-readable format is also stored in the header of the syllabus file so that both versions are found in one place making it easier to keep in sync. How to enter this information in the syllabus file will be presented in the learning units that follow . Supporting elements There are a few supporting elements that makeup the learning materials set. In addition to the ones that are required for the technical implementation of the publishing workflow (to be discussed later), the following files are necessary to be defined by the instructional designers: license this is a text oriented version of the CC license of your choice.

Once a working environment consisting of the recommended tools is in place and the initial concepts regarding the underlying file formats have been adopted, the instructional designer is then ready to start with production of the learning objects themselves. The first step on this journey is the introduction to an open text format \u2013 Markdown, and a robust version management system, Git. Learning Objectives Recognize and use open file formats for producing FAIR learning objects Use a version management system for versioning file contents Select freely accessible software tools for working with the file formats Operate an already created automated publishing workflow for processing any changes made to the learning materials Explain the process of making changes to the learning objects and publishing them as a Git book Target Audience Attendees of the FAIR-by-Design ToT live webinar Duration 120 mins Prerequisites Completed Stage 3: Design Learning Tools Training BBB room Browser Menti access or BBB quiz interaction GitHub Desktop Software Obsidian Markdown Editor File Formats During the production phase of the FAIR-by-Design learning objects, three important aspects need to be taken into account at all times: The intermediary and final file formats of the produced learning objects; The required software tools for producing and consuming the learning objects; Ensuring the future-proof compatibility and longevity of the learning objects. We will tackle all of these aspects during the training, starting with the introduction of the recommended intermediary and final file formats. An intermediate file format is a file format used during the production phase of the learning objects, and is aimed at direct contributors to the content itself. A final file format is obtained by transforming the intermediary file format, making it ready for consumption by a wider audience, focusing on its visual representation, interactivity, and ease-of-use. Markdown Markdown is a text-based intermediary file format that is easy to learn and use. It is the recommended intermediary file format for designing FAIR-by-Design learning objects, with a number of advantages over alternatives: plain text, editable with any editor across all possible platforms at any time; compatibility with version management systems, granular preview of changes down to the character level between file revisions; easy collaboration in the case of multiple contributors when combined with the use of a version management system; large eco-system of dedicated tools including: editors, convertors, validators; plethora of options for obtaining a visually appealing final format representation. Markdown has basic support for document formatting through the use of a specific, easy-to-learn, syntax for defining distinctive elements: headings, bulleted lists, numbered lists, quotes, tables... Users have the option of either manually formatting their documents by using the respective syntax, or using a What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) editors which provide a more beginner friendly user interface, similar to traditional text processors. No matter the chosen approach, the end-result is the same, and compatibility with the complete Markdown ecosystem is preserved. Markdown Alternatives Traditional alternatives to Markdown documents are the native file formats of the various popular text processors in use today, such as Microsoft Word (.docx) and the Open Document Text (.odt) file format which is the primary one for many open-source alternatives such as LibreOffice and OpenOffice. However, while these file formats are well-established and popular today, they are not the first choice when producing FAIR-by-Design learning objects. Both formats are binary in nature, meaning that version control management using external tools is much more complicated, and changes cannot be granularly followed. Due to this, collaboration on these documents is more challenging, especially in cases when no third-party, proprietary, cloud-services are involved. Compatibility is also negatively impacted, since formatting consistency is not guaranteed between different text processors, or even between different versions of the same text processor in certain cases. This has a negative impact on the overall accessibility, restricting the use of such materials only to users with a compatible computing platform and text processor version, which in many cases can be a proprietary, commercial, software. The FAIR-by-Design methodology by no means restricts the use of alternative intermediary file formats to Markdown. Users can continue using traditional text processor formats such as .docx with which they might be more familiar, as long as they are aware of the drawbacks of such an approach. The previously discussed restrictions should be carefully evaluated especially in terms of version control management, and ensuring compatibility with newer software versions in the future. Markdown's Relationship to Final File Formats Perhaps the most popular final file format for Markdown is HTML. An additional advantage of Markdown is the simplicity with which it can be converted to an HTML representation whose visual properties can be further customized to achieve the desired effect. Such HTML pages can be hosted publicly for free, allowing seamless access to the learning materials for anyone, from anywhere, as long as they have a device with a web browser at hand. A popular approach today is to combine multiple such HTML pages and produce an online book, commonly referred to as a Git book, a name that is derived from the Git version management system used for the intermediary files comprising the book. One of the focus points of this training is the creation of such Git books. An alternative final file format that is also widely popular and supported by Markdown documents is PDF. The Slides Conundrum In practice, Markdown can be used both for writing text heavy documents that can later optionally be converted to a Git book, as well as for slides design, with the end-goal of creating a presentation. Software such as Quatro and Marpit facilitate the use of Markdown, along with all of its previously discussed benefits, for creating presentations which can be exported either to HTML or PowerPoint (.pptx) documents. However, at present, the creation of interactive, and visually rich presentations with these tools is a more involved process, requiring greater experience with the specific framework itself (be it Quatro, Marpit, or an alternative). To overcome this, and to reduce the technical complexity of creating presentations, traditional tools from this space such as PowerPoint, LibreOffice Impress, Google Slides... can be used. These presentations can be deposited in version management systems such as Git, but it will not be possible to leverage its main benefits, due to the binary nature of the underlying file format. Version Management Git is the most popular version management system in use today. It is available for all popular platforms either as a first-party command line utility or through third-party graphical user interface (GUI) clients. Git uses the concept of repositories which can granularly manage the versions of all objects placed within it. File changes are committed to a repository and each commit is automatically associated a unique and random identifier. In addition to this identifier, each commit is also described by its author, commit title and commit description. A single Git repository can be used by multiple users, each contributing and committing their changes. To facilitate remote collaboration, a Git repository can be shared publicly or privately. Git hosting services, such as GitHub and GitLab offer this functionality today for free. While Git can also be used independently from such hosting services, either completely locally and offline or by devising a custom synchronization workflow with third parties, in reality this is rarely the case. Git repositories can also be forked , meaning that their current state is copied to a brand new repository, preserving all history. The user who has initiated the fork can then make any desired changes directly to their own fork of the repository. If desired, such changes can optionally be reconciled and added to the original repository from which the fork was created, provided that they are accepted by the original owner. This is possible due to the fact that the repositories will have a shared history at least up until the point when the fork was made. In case their files have diverged (e.g., both the original and forked repository contain changes to the same files), and if these changes are conflicting (e.g., changes to the same part of a given document), Git will mark these changes and leave it up to the owner of the repository to decide how to proceed, and what version to accept. Below is a list of common Git related terminology which will be useful for the remaining of the training: Git repository \u2013 a collaborative space where files can be versioned Git commit \u2013 a granular change of a single or multiple files in the repository, identified by a random unique identifier, the committer's name, email address, short commit title and an optional longer commit description. A commit can contain file additions, modifications, removal, or relocation to a different directory. Git clone \u2013 an action to download locally an existing Git repository. A repository hosted on a public Git hosting service such as GitHub can be cloned by anyone (assuming it is public) on their local machines. Once downloaded, users can explore the repository and optionally send their contributed changes upstream, if they have been assigned the necessary permissions. Git fork \u2013 a 1:1 copy of an existing Git repository. A fork of an existing repository results with the creation of a brand new repository which will have a shared history with the original one up until the fork was made. The owner of the forked repository will be the user who initiated the fork. The original owner of the repository does not have any right in the forked repository by default. Pull request/Merge request \u2013 when changes are made to a forked repository, they can be contributed back to the original repository by creating a merge request or a pull request (the terms are synonyms, depending on the platform either one can be used). With this approach a privileged user from the original repository from which the fork was initiated can review the changes and decide whether to accept them, modify them, or outright reject them. Forks can exist independently of the original repository forever. Activity: First Steps with Git As part of the preparation for this training, participants should already have downloaded and installed the GitHub Desktop Client , and created a free personal account on GitHub . To simulate the preparation of FAIR-by-Design learning objects, you are going to create a fork of the FAIR-by-Design Learning Object Templates repository, and then clone it locally as to continue working on the materials. When using GitHub, repositories can either be hosted under the personal profile, or under an organization. Hosting a repository under an organization provides greater flexibility, since the organization name can be customized, and multiple owners can be added to an organizational repositories, unlike personal ones. Repository owners can edit the settings of the repository, such as enable third-party integrations or change its visibility level. We recommend to create and use a dedicated organization on GitHub for hosting repositories related to the development of FAIR-by-Design materials. Follow these steps to complete the initial Git setup for your new FAIR-by-Design repository Login to GitHub . Click on the profile picture in the right hand corner and select Your organizations . Create a new organization by clicking on the New organization button. Choose the Free plan by clicking on the Create a free organization button. All of the features in the Team plan are available for free to public repositories when using the Free plan, as of this writing. Enter the desired name for the new organization, and provide your email in the Contact email field. Select yourself as the organization owner by answering My personal account to the This organization belongs to question. Note that the selected organization name will be part of the URLs for all repositories created within the organization. For example when creating a repository materials under the FAIR-by-Design-Demo organization, the complete URL will be https://github.com/FAIR-by-Design-Demo/materials . In the next step you should be presented with an option to invite additional members to your organization. This can be skipped for now if no collaborators need to be invited at this point. You should be redirected to the home page of your newly created organization. By default the organization will be public, meaning that its information such as name and description can be accessed by anyone. If desired, you can restrict the visibility of the organization to only members by using the privacy controls on the right hand side of the landing page. The next step is to create our first repository in the organization by creating a fork of the FAIR-by-Design Learning Object Templates repository. To do so, navigate to its page and click the Fork button in the right-hand corner. Make sure to set your newly created organization as the owner of the repository. Finish filling-out the forking form by entering the desired repository name and its description. By default forks are created with the same name as the original (upstream) repository, but this can be customized directly on the form. After a few moments the forking process will be completed and you will be redirected to the homepage of your new repository. The final step before we can start working on the development of learning objects is to clone the repository locally. To do so, we will use the GitHub Desktop Client that should already be installed as part of the preparation steps before attending the training. Open the application and authenticate using your GitHub credentials. Once logged in, you will be asked what name and email address you would like to associate with your future commits. You can either accept the defaults which are your GitHub username as the name and your GitHub provided email, or you can customize them as you see fit. Using either the first run wizard that should start automatically after logging-in for the first time ( Clone a repository on your hard drive... button) or by manually selecting File -> Clone repository , make a local copy of the forked repository. If the repository is not yet visible, make sure to click the refresh button. Make sure to specify the desired location on your filesystem where to place the data from the cloned repository. If asked whether you would like to contribute to the original repository or continue working independently on the forked one, choose the second option, For my own purposes . At this point we have created our own fork of the FAIR-by-Design templates repository and we have also cloned (downloaded) all of its contents locally, so we are ready to start producing our very own FAIR learning objects. However, one final step remains, and that is to go over how to work with Markdown files.

We will tackle all of these aspects during the training, starting with the introduction of the recommended intermediary and final file formats. An intermediate file format is a file format used during the production phase of the learning objects, and is aimed at direct contributors to the content itself. A final file format is obtained by transforming the intermediary file format, making it ready for consumption by a wider audience, focusing on its visual representation, interactivity, and ease-of-use.","title":"File Formats"},{"location":"Stage%204%20%E2%80%93%20Produce/08-Development%20Tools/08-Introduction%20to%20Markdown%20and%20Git/#markdown","text":"Markdown is a text-based intermediary file format that is easy to learn and use.

Markdown has basic support for document formatting through the use of a specific, easy-to-learn, syntax for defining distinctive elements: headings, bulleted lists, numbered lists, quotes, tables... Users have the option of either manually formatting their documents by using the respective syntax, or using a What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) editors which provide a more beginner friendly user interface, similar to traditional text processors.

However, while these file formats are well-established and popular today, they are not the first choice when producing FAIR-by-Design learning objects. Both formats are binary in nature, meaning that version control management using external tools is much more complicated, and changes cannot be granularly followed. Due to this, collaboration on these documents is more challenging, especially in cases when no third-party, proprietary, cloud-services are involved. Compatibility is also negatively impacted, since formatting consistency is not guaranteed between different text processors, or even between different versions of the same text processor in certain cases. This has a negative impact on the overall accessibility, restricting the use of such materials only to users with a compatible computing platform and text processor version, which in many cases can be a proprietary, commercial, software. The FAIR-by-Design methodology by no means restricts the use of alternative intermediary file formats to Markdown. Users can continue using traditional text processor formats such as .docx with which they might be more familiar, as long as they are aware of the drawbacks of such an approach. The previously discussed restrictions should be carefully evaluated especially in terms of version control management, and ensuring compatibility with newer software versions in the future.","title":"Markdown Alternatives"},{"location":"Stage%204%20%E2%80%93%20Produce/08-Development%20Tools/08-Introduction%20to%20Markdown%20and%20Git/#markdowns-relationship-to-final-file-formats","text":"Perhaps the most popular final file format for Markdown is HTML.

A popular approach today is to combine multiple such HTML pages and produce an online book, commonly referred to as a Git book, a name that is derived from the Git version management system used for the intermediary files comprising the book.

Since Markdown at its core is simply a text format, any editor that is capable of working with plain text files can in fact also be used for writing Markdown. Despite this, it would be helpful if the chosen software also introduces some quality-of-life improvements, which might make the process of writing in this format easier. The required features might vary from person to person, but we can generally accept that the editor should offer a WYSIWYG editing mode for inexperienced Markdown writers, as well as some sort of a live preview of the written content, showing how the content might appear once rendered to a final output format. Introduction to Obsidian In this training we will be using the Obsidian editor for writing all of the Markdown files throughout the different modules. Obsidian is a free-to-use cross-platform software which is simple to use and can be significantly extended through the use of community plugins, thanks to its modular architecture. We will be using some of those community plugins later in the activity to augment the default out-of-the-box functionality. Experienced Markdown writers are more than welcome to continue using their editor of choice and follow along from the comfort of their existing writing environment. Obsidian offers a live preview for all written content and has a built-in search mechanism that can be used for quickly searching across all files placed in the current working repository. Opening a folder in Obsidian transforms it to a so called vault , but for our purposes this will be transparent since vaults can be created both from scratch as well as using an existing folder hierarchy. An important thing to note is that all changes made to the Obsidian configuration are relevant only for the current vault (the specific directory that has been opened). Opening a different Git repository in Obsidian will create a new vault, which also means that the plugins would need to be reinstalled. Please keep this in mind after the training when working on your own Git repository. Activity: Setting up Obsidian for Working with Markdown Files The goal of this activity is to configure Obsidian to work with the cloned repository, paying attention to required plugins, configuration options, and specific features. Obsidian should already be installed on your workstation as part of the preparation process for the training. Make sure to launch it and select Open folder as vault option from the quick start wizard. Navigate to the folder where you have cloned the forked repository in the previous activity. Once the vault is opened, on the left hand side of the screen you will be presented with a navigation tree, while the right hand side will be reserved for file editing and live preview. By default Obsidian is in the live preview mode, meaning that anything you write will be automatically shown in its rendered form once you move the cursor to the next line. Only the line which is currently being edited is shown in its raw Markdown form. To change this behavior you can use the book icon at the very top right edge of the screen, also pointed out in the picture below. We will discuss more about the Markdown syntax and be able to see what the different preview modes enable later in the training. At first glance it seems that Obsidian does not offer a WYSIWYG editing experience, since there is no editing toolbox to be seen. While this is certainly true, the problem can be solved by installing a community plugin, which would enable point-and-click buttons for the most common Markdown formatting actions such as: headings, bullets, quotes, coloring... Plugins can be installed by navigating to the settings pane using the cog icon in the bottom left corner. Once in the settings wizard, navigate to the Community plugins section and confirm the Turn on community plugins choice. Click on the Browse button and search for the Editing Toolbar plugin by Cuman . Confirm the installation of the plugin by clicking on the card and selecting Install . Once installed, Enable the plugin. Search for the Markdown Table Editor plugin by Gannessh Kumar R P . Install it and enable it. Close all open settings windows and return to the editor preview mode. You should be greeted by a brand new toolbar at the top of the screen, similar to what is available in popular text processors. Before moving forward, it would be beneficial to configure Obsidian to follow the recommended file hierarchy when working with attachments. The forked template repository assumes that all images will be stored in an attachments folder created at the same location where the Markdown files is stored. Obsidian supports automatic export of copy/pasted images, but we need to perform an extra step as to configure it to respect this file hierarchy. To do so, reopen the Obsidian settings window by using the cog icon in the bottom left hand corner. Choose the Files & Links menu and set Default location for new attachments to In subfolder under current folder . Enter attachments in the Subfolder name input field. To be compliant with the base Markdown specification, make sure to also set the New link format option to Relative path to file on the same settings page. Additionally, make sure to disable the option Use [[Wikilinks]] . Even though the repository contains files in different formats than Markdown (for example CITATION.CFF , or LICENSE ), by default they are not shown in the Obsidian directory tree. To force Obsidian to show all files, despite their format, navigate to the Files & Links section of the settings page and make sure to enable Detect all file extensions . Once this option is toggled, new files will appear in the Obsidian sidebar. Note that files other than Markdown (files with no .md extension) will not be natively opened in Obsidian, and you may be prompted to select an alternative editor instead when trying to edit them. To test the new configuration you can go ahead and copy an arbitrary image and directly paste it into a Markdown document open on Obsidian. The image should automatically appear in the preview, and a newly created attachments folder will also be present in the navigation tree on the left sde. Closing Remarks Since Obsidian supports the concept of vaults , whenever relaunching the software, it will reopen the previously used vault. If for any reason you would like to switch to another vault (e.g., work on a different Git repository), you can do so by clicking the vault icon in the bottom left hand corner, which would launch the vault selection wizard.

We will discuss more about the Markdown syntax and be able to see what the different preview modes enable later in the training. At first glance it seems that Obsidian does not offer a WYSIWYG editing experience, since there is no editing toolbox to be seen. While this is certainly true, the problem can be solved by installing a community plugin, which would enable point-and-click buttons for the most common Markdown formatting actions such as: headings, bullets, quotes, coloring... Plugins can be installed by navigating to the settings pane using the cog icon in the bottom left corner. Once in the settings wizard, navigate to the Community plugins section and confirm the Turn on community plugins choice. Click on the Browse button and search for the Editing Toolbar plugin by Cuman . Confirm the installation of the plugin by clicking on the card and selecting Install . Once installed, Enable the plugin. Search for the Markdown Table Editor plugin by Gannessh Kumar R P . Install it and enable it. Close all open settings windows and return to the editor preview mode. You should be greeted by a brand new toolbar at the top of the screen, similar to what is available in popular text processors. Before moving forward, it would be beneficial to configure Obsidian to follow the recommended file hierarchy when working with attachments. The forked template repository assumes that all images will be stored in an attachments folder created at the same location where the Markdown files is stored. Obsidian supports automatic export of copy/pasted images, but we need to perform an extra step as to configure it to respect this file hierarchy. To do so, reopen the Obsidian settings window by using the cog icon in the bottom left hand corner. Choose the Files & Links menu and set Default location for new attachments to In subfolder under current folder . Enter attachments in the Subfolder name input field. To be compliant with the base Markdown specification, make sure to also set the New link format option to Relative path to file on the same settings page. Additionally, make sure to disable the option Use [[Wikilinks]] . Even though the repository contains files in different formats than Markdown (for example CITATION.CFF , or LICENSE ), by default they are not shown in the Obsidian directory tree. To force Obsidian to show all files, despite their format, navigate to the Files & Links section of the settings page and make sure to enable Detect all file extensions . Once this option is toggled, new files will appear in the Obsidian sidebar. Note that files other than Markdown (files with no .md extension) will not be natively opened in Obsidian, and you may be prompted to select an alternative editor instead when trying to edit them. To test the new configuration you can go ahead and copy an arbitrary image and directly paste it into a Markdown document open on Obsidian. The image should automatically appear in the preview, and a newly created attachments folder will also be present in the navigation tree on the left sde.","title":"Activity: Setting up Obsidian for Working with Markdown Files"},{"location":"Stage%204%20%E2%80%93%20Produce/08-Development%20Tools/08-Setting%20up%20a%20Markdown%20Editor/#closing-remarks","text":"Since Obsidian supports the concept of vaults , whenever relaunching the software, it will reopen the previously used vault.

Additionally, existing Git book frameworks today are capable of producing complete websites, following a navigation strategy designed by the authors themselves. We will have a look at a popular Git book framework called MkDocs and we will show the necessary steps to configure it, below. The main goal would be to achieve a \"set it and forget it\" scenario, where once set up, MkDocs will not require any additional interaction or reconfiguration during the remaining stages of the FAIR-by-Design methodology. All new Markdown files should automatically be converted to an HTML representation and be visible in the rendered Git book. To make the process of initial set up easier, the already forked templates repository at the beginning of this unit can be reused, instead of setting up everything from scratch. In the activity that we will make the necessary adjustments to the forked repository, create an example page, and push our very content to the Git book. Activity: Setting up a Git Book with MkDocs As part of this activity we will be working on the already forked template repository FAIR-by-Design-Methodology/templates , reusing its content. As a reminder, the process of forking an existing repository results in the creation of a new repository which is an identical copy of the original, and the owner is the user/organization who initiated the fork. Since at this point we already forked the repository in Introduction to Markdown and Git , we will only change the GitHub settings for the new repository to allow for automatic building of the MkDocs Git book. Finally we will edit some of the existing Markdown files so that the first version of our Git book can be built. Step 1: Making the Necessary Changes to the Repository's Configuration Navigate to GitHub and open the fork created previously. The page at this point should look similar to the picture below. Note that some of the files might differ, depending on when you are following this guide. The first configuration step is to allow the existing workflows which were defined in the template repository to run in the forked one as well. Workflows are automated scripts written as a sequence of steps which need to be executed upon a certain event (e.g., file modification). The template repository, and as a result any forked repositories, heavily rely on such workflows to automate the continuous updating of the Git book, but also to facilitate easy publishing on Zenodo, discussed in more details in the next Stage. The workflows are generic and do not require extensive manual modification before they can be applied to forked repositories as well. Note that workflows are run only when the content is pushed to GitHub, and do not execute on local changes made to the locally cloned repository. To enable the workflows, click on the Actions tab and then choose I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them . Once enabled, we need to allow the workflows to make automated changes to files present in the repository. This is needed so that the workflows can automatically update the Git book with information such as the license, attribution, and metadata. By default workflow scripts are only allowed read only access to the repository content. Navigate to your organization's landing page. Note that this page is different than the repository landing page. One way of opening the organization's page is by clicking on the profile picture on the top right hand corner, selecting Your organizations and then choosing the organization's name from the list. From the landing page, choose Settings Select Actions -> General from the left hand navigation menu. Scroll down until the section titled Workflow permissions becomes visible and click on the Read and write permissions options, before saving the changes using the Save button. The change that we just made was at the GitHub Organization level. It was required so that individual repositories within the organization could also enable Read and write permissions for workflows. The next step is to verify that the extra permissions have been assigned to the forked repository as well. Navigate to the repository Settings page (reminder that these Settings are independent from the Organization settings that we just altered), choose Actions -> General , scroll down until the Workflow permissions section appears, and verify that Read and Write Permissions is selected. If it is not selected, select it and save the changes. Step 2: Making Local Changes to the Repository To test the Git book functionality, let's edit some of the existing content in the syllabus template available in resources/syllabus.md and verify that it will be rendered to HTML and made publicly accessibly from any web browser on the planet. Open the GitHub Desktop client and verify that all of the commits from the upstream repo are downloaded locally by clicking on the Fetch origin button. Open Obsidian. Using the left hand file tree open the syllabus file in the resources directory. Make an arbitrary change to its content, e.g. change the Target audience . Switch back to GitHub Desktop and verify that the change has been registered. The above picture shows one of the great advantages of Markdown, the ability to have a detailed representation of what has been changed in each of the files. Lines that have been removed are shown in red with a - prefix, while lines that have been added are shown in green with a + prefix. We can commit the changes so that they are part of the official history of the repository by adding a commit title and an optional description. Local commits are not automatically pushed to GitHub. To do so, we have to explicitly select the Push origin button that should also show a small icon with an arrow at this point, signalling that there is one local commit which has not been uploaded. Once the changes are pushed to GitHub, the corresponding workflow script for building the Git book will be triggered. You can verify this by going to the landing page of the repository on GitHub and checking the workflow status. While the workflow is in progress there will be a small brown button next to the unique commit identifier ( 4719aa1 in the picture above). Should the workflow complete successfully, the brown dot will be changed to a green checkmark as shown in the picture above. If an error is encountered during the workflow's execution, a red cross will be shown. Step 3: Enabling Free Hosting of the Git Book on GitHub Since this is the first time that the Git book has been rendered using one of the automatic workflows, we need to enable free website hosting provided by GitHub. This action needs to be performed only once. Any subsequent changes to the markdown files can simply be committed and pushed, after which they will appear \"automatically\" on the live website. Go to the repository settings by clicking on the Settings button and navigate to the Pages section. In the Branch section, click on the dropdown menu and select gh-pages . Once gh-pages has been selected, another field will appear that will be pre-populated with the option / (root) . Leave that field as is. Save the changes using the Save button. Wait a couple of moments and refresh the page. A new section titled Your site is live at... should be visible at the top. The URL is generated automatically based on the GitHub organization name and the repository title. Clicking on the URL should open the Git book in your web browser. The change made in the previous steps should also be visible. Any future changes, after being committed and pushed to GitHub using the GitHub Desktop client will automatically be shown on the live web page. In the next activities we will systematically edit each Markdown template one by one, and preview our changes in the same way as we did now. Step 4: Customizing the Title of the Git Book Web Site After getting our first glimpse of how a Git book can be created and continuously updated, the final technical step before proceeding with content development activities is to customize the title of the web site, which appears on all pages on the top header and as a title of the table of contents section, as shown in the picture below. The setting that controls the title is found in the mkdocs.yml file, which unfortunately, due to its specific syntax, cannot be edited directly in Obsidian. Navigate to the folder where the Git repository is cloned on your file system. Tip: this can be done directly from within the GitHub Desktop Client by clicking on the Show in Explorer (Microsoft Windows) or Show in Finder (MacOS) button. Open the mkdocs.yml file in your favorite text editor. Change the value of the site_name setting found on the first line. Make sure to surround the new value in single or double quotes, to avoid any unexpected syntax errors. Commit the changes and push them. Refresh the web page in the browser, making sure that the new site name appears both in the page header and at the top of the table of contents section. Key Takeaways At this point we have a functional environment which we can use to practice the FAIR-by-Design methodology. We set up the required tools (Obsidian and GitHub Desktop), got introduced to GitHub and Markdown, and created our very own Git book. We also tackled the difference between the various intermediate and final output formats, giving recommendations on which ones to choose. We will use these newly obtained skills in the sections that follow, gradually building our FAIR-by-Design course, starting with the development of a Unit Plan.

To facilitate the visual design options which are taken for granted when using full-fledged word processors such as headings, letter formatting using bold, italic, unordered lists, ordered lists, etc..., Markdown must resort to a special, but simple, syntax. In the sections that follow we will explore ways in which we can accomplish the following tasks using Markdown: define headings at different levels create ordered lists create unordered lists format text to be shown as a link insert images use tables with arbitrary number of rows and columns format text write metadata In addition to the concepts above, we will also tackle ways in which additional metadata information can be assigned to Markdown files through the use of special headers, which are not rendered when rendering to a final file format such as HTML or PDF. The participants will have a chance to get hands-on experience with all of these concepts by taking part in the interactive activities organized throughout this section. They focus on working with the existing Markdown templates prepared by the FAIR-by-Design methodology team, as well as on reusing existing content that might not necessarily confirm to the FAIR-by-Design methodology at first and adapting it. Overview of the Markdown Syntax In this section we will go over the basic Markdown syntax that will be needed to edit the existing Markdown templates. For each action, we will attempt to describe two approaches: manual, without utilizing any Obsidian extensions; assisted, where the WYSIWYG editing toolbar is used, together with additional extensions with the end-goal of simplifying the Markdown typing experience. When working on your own learning materials, you are welcome to use whatever approach works best for you. It is also very much possible to take a hybrid approach, writing raw Markdown by hand for some simple aspects, while resorting to extensions for other, more complex tasks (e.g., table formatting). Note that Markdown only defines the syntax for the document formatting, the final visual appearance of the output such as the font size and color is in most cases determined by the design choices of the tool used for converting .md files. The very page that you are currently reading has also been written as a Markdown document which has then been converted to HTML using the MkDocs framework. In this the chosen MkDocs theme has defined that headings will have a blue color, while links will be pink. Of course, if desired, these visual options can also be further customized by modifying the MkDocs configuration. Defining Headings Headings can be defined by prefixing the line with the # symbol. The heading level is dependant on the number of # present, so a single # character represents heading at level 1, ## represent a heading 2, ### heading 3... Below is an excerpt of a document which uses different heading levels. # This is heading 1 Lorem ipsum... ## This is heading 2 Lorem ipsum... ### This is heading 3 Lorem ipsum... The toolbar in Obsidian has dedicated selection buttons for the most common headings: Ordered Lists Ordered lists can be created in a very intuitive way, by simply prefixing the line with the appropriate number: 1. Item 1 2. Item 2 3. Item 3 It is recommended to have an empty line both before and after the ordered list, helping legibility: Lorem ipsum dolor est. 1. Item 1 2. Item 2 3. Item 3 Lorem ipsum dolor est. The image below shows how ordered lists can be created using the toolbar in Obsidian. Note that once the first element is defined, future new lines will automatically be prefixed with the next number in the sequence. To interrupt the automatic numbering, and thus break out of the ordered list, simply enter two new lines one after the other. Nesting Ordered Lists Ordered lists can of course be nested. Simply press the Tab key on a blank line and reset the numbering, like so: 1. Item 1 1. Item 1.1 2. Item 1.2 The same can be accomplished using the toolbar in Obsidian, by clicking on the (un)indent button or pressing Tab on the keyboard. Unordered Lists Unordered lists can be created in a similar way as ordered list, with the only difference being the prefix. Instead of a number, the line prefix in this case can either be a - or * . - first thing - second thing - third thing As expected, the toolbar in Obsidian also has a dedicated button for creating unordered lists: Nesting Unordered Lists Unordered lists can be nested in the same way as ordered lists. In this case, after clicking tab on a new line simply enter the preferred unordered list character ( - or * ). Additionally, it also possible to have a top-level ordered list and the nested list to be unordered or vice versa. 1. Element 1 2. Element 2 - subelement 1 - subelement 2 3. Element 3 1. sublement 1 2. subelement 2 When using the toolbar in Obsidian, the same (un)indent button can be used both for formatting the nesting of numbered and unnumbered lists. Links The syntax for defining links is: [ FAIR-by-Design Methodology ]( https://zenodo.org/record/7875541 ) The part in the [] brackets will be the link text, while the () define the target location. The above link would be rendered as FAIR-by-Design Methodology . When using Obsidian with the toolbar, simply write the link text, select it, and click the anchor button. This will put square brackets around the existing text, and provide empty brackets for the link location: It is also possible to add relative links to an arbitrary heading on the existing page or a different page. The syntax for doing so is: [ See here for more details about unordered lists ]( 09-Markdown Syntax.md#unordered-lists ) The above would be rendered as See here for more details about unordered lists . Diving into more details, the syntax is: markdown-file.md#heading . The first part is the Markdown file name, as stored on your computer, then a single # sign (no matter the heading level) and finally the full name of the heading in all lowercase letters where any spaces are replaced by a - . Advanced Linking with Obsidian Trainees are recommended to go over this section once they have familiarized themselves with the rest of the Markdown concepts. During the initial reading this section can be skipped. Linking between learning units or even to specific sections of a given learning unit is a common task when designing learning materials. However, when it comes to complex trainings involving many Markdown files, manually writing the location of the reference document can be an error prone operation. Obsidian has built-in functionality to make the process of linking between Markdown documents easier. For Obsidian to use the appropriate Markdown syntax, ensure that the option Use [[Wikilinks]] is disabled in Obsidian Settings -> Files & Links , as discussed in 08-Development Tools . Whenever a link needs to be inserted, simply press [[ on the keyboard and an Obsidian autocompletion window will open. Search for the title of the desired page to which you would like to link and simply press Enter . By default Obsdiian will enter the page name as the name of the link, but this can be changed by altering the text in the [] brackets. Obsidian can also help with the initial construction of a link to a subsection within a document, but manual changes are needed in this case. To link to an arbitrary heading within a document: open the autocompletion window using [[ find the page that you would like to link to instead of pressing Enter , press the # key Obsidian will open a heading discovery window which you can use to select the appropriate heading Pressing Enter will construct the link One final change needs to be made to the link, since it will not be in the MkDocs expected format. As discussed previously, the full name of the heading which is specified after the # sign should be typed in all lowercase letters where any spaces are replaced by a - . The link can be manually adjusted to conform to this spec by converting all uppercase letters to lowercase and replacing all occurrences of %20 with - after the # , as shown in the image below. Images The syntax for inserting images is very similar to the one for inserting links. The only difference is the ! prefix which is required: ![ Cute Animal ]( https://static.mrezhi.net/general/kitten.jpg ) The above would be rendered as: (Image by Gundula Vogel from Pixabay) In this case the text between the [] brackets will be added as an alt text for the image, visible when the image cannot be shown or when the user is using accessibility tools such as a screen reader. In case a locally available image needs to be inserted, Obsidian supports simple copy-pasting of the desired file. It will automatically be uploaded to the attachments folder and linked within the currently open Markdown document. This behavior is shown in the image below. When pushed to the Git repository, the automatic MkDocs workflow will take care of transforming the relative file path of the image to the correct URL. Videos Embedding videos is natively supported by pasting the relevant HTML embed code that can be automatically generated by many video hosting websites. For example, to embed a YouTube video, the following steps need to be followed: Navigate to the YouTube page of the video and click the Share button. Choose the Embed option. Customize the options for the generated embed code or copy it as is. the video can automatically start at a predefined timestamp by using the Start at option. visitors can be allowed to control the video playback (pause, skip, playback speed) if the Show player controls option is ticked. Paste the embed code in the relevant Markdown file in Obsidian. Pressing enter will show a live preview of the embedded video in Obsidian. Tables Unlike the previous elements, creating tables by hand in Markdown can be a somewhat complicated process. The basic syntax for a three-column, three-row table is given below: | ID | Project | Year | |----|-------------|------| | 1 | Skills4EOSC | 2022 | | 2 | NI4OS | 2019 | While visually simple, creating more complex tables manually can become an elaborate process. The header row is separated from the rest of the rows by the |----|-------------|------| line above. The number of dashes between the | is not important, and it can be varied to accomplish a better visual representation in the source Markdown file. The above table, when rendered, is shown as: ID Project Year 1 Skills4EOSC 2022 2 NI4OS 2019 Obsidian, using the third party plugin that we already installed in one of the previous activities provides a simpler approach to creating tables, using a graphical interface. After the Markdown Table Editor plugin is installed, it can be used by clicking on its dedicated button on the left-hand side. Depending on the current context, one of two options is possible: if an existing table is selected, the plugin will launch in editing mode if no table is present, a new one will be created, and the edit mode will be launched If additional rows or columns need to be added, that can be accomplished by clicking on the three dots next to the currently selected cell: Once satisfied with the result, the Markdown can automatically be generated by clicking the Update Table button. In case other editors that have no support for table plugins are used, free services such as Tables Generator can be of help. In this case, a visual editor for the table is offered, similar to the Obsidian plugin, and the corresponding Markdown can be copied and then pasted into the .md file. Text Formatting Markdown also supports common text formatting operations, such as bold, italic, and strikethrough. The syntax is presented below: **This is a bold text.** *This is an italic text.* ***This is both a bold and italic text.*** ~~This is a strikethrough~~ The editing toolbar in Obsidian offers dedicated buttons for all of these operations. Additionally, using the editing toolbar it is also possible to change the text color and background, but these two options should be used sparingly, since it is accomplished by directly writing HTML, instead of using a dedicated Markdown syntax. Such behavior might lead to incompatibilities with third-party Markdown editors and rendering engines. Metadata Arbitrary metadata information can be added to any Markdown file at the very beginning of the document, using a dedicated section: --- title: My Document author: - John Doe - Jane Doe tags: - FAIR-by-Design - Markdown --- Most Markdown engines, including MkDocs offer special treatment for content between the two --- lines. In the case of MkDocs, the title sets the page title, as shown in the left-hand navigation menu. The tags are shown at the very beginning of the page, as pill shaped objects. In the MkDocs theme used for the FAIR-by-Design theme, the authors information is not directly utilized, but there are other themes that do leverage this content. It is worth nothing that some fields have a specific syntax in the metadata. The metadata section uses a markup language called YAML, where the indentation is very important. Additionally, fields that can contain more than a single value, such as tags and author in this case, must have each value written on a new line, prefixed with a - and having a consistent indentation of 2 or 4 spaces. The metadata section can also support arbitrary fields, besides those shown in the example, as needed. Activity: Editing the Lesson Plan Template Using the knowledged obtained in the previous section, our task is now to fill out the lesson plan template with the necessary information. Before starting, make sure that the local clone of the repository is up-to-date with the latest changes that might have been made by your other collaborators. This can be accomplished using the Pull origin button in the GitHub Desktop client. In case any changes have been detected which have not been synced locally, a new Pull origin blue button will appear which needs to be clicked. After validating the state of the local repository, continue by executing the following actions: Make a copy of the resources/Learning Unit/template_unit_lesson_plan.md in the same directory, naming the new file demo_plan.md . Open the resources/Learning Unit/demo_plan.md file using the directory explorer on the left-hand side of the Obsidian window. Start by filling out the necessary metadata information present at the top of the document between the --- lines. Make sure to set the title , authors , and tags fields. Change the heading 1 (recognizable by having a single # as prefix) with the title of the unit. Change the heading 2 to Goals and create an unordered list containing at least 3 goals for the lesson. Edit the unordered list in the Location section. Fill out the estimated total duration of the lesson by inputting a new line in the Total duration section. Format the duration text as both bold and italic. Provide the recommended number of attendees in the Number of Attendees section. Convert the unordered list in the Learning Objectives section to an ordered list and enter 3 learning objectives at a minimum. Edit the sample plan table in the Plan section using the table editing plugin in Obsidian. Remove any unneeded rows as needed. Enter at least one arbitrary link in the Activities section. Provide Assessment information. Make sure to add at least one nested list (either ordered or unordered) to an existing element. Alter the Certificate or Badge section by providing an image of the Badge that can be obtained by completing the lesson. An arbitrary image can also be used. Complete the lesson plan by filling out the Reflection and Comments sections. Open the GitHub Desktop application, enter a commit title and an optional commit message and commit the changes by clicking on the Commit to main button. Upload the changed files to GitHub.com by clicking on the blue Push origin button.

To facilitate the visual design options which are taken for granted when using full-fledged word processors such as headings, letter formatting using bold, italic, unordered lists, ordered lists, etc..., Markdown must resort to a special, but simple, syntax. In the sections that follow we will explore ways in which we can accomplish the following tasks using Markdown: define headings at different levels create ordered lists create unordered lists format text to be shown as a link insert images use tables with arbitrary number of rows and columns format text write metadata In addition to the concepts above, we will also tackle ways in which additional metadata information can be assigned to Markdown files through the use of special headers, which are not rendered when rendering to a final file format such as HTML or PDF. The participants will have a chance to get hands-on experience with all of these concepts by taking part in the interactive activities organized throughout this section. They focus on working with the existing Markdown templates prepared by the FAIR-by-Design methodology team, as well as on reusing existing content that might not necessarily confirm to the FAIR-by-Design methodology at first and adapting it.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Stage%204%20%E2%80%93%20Produce/09-Content%20Development/09-Markdown%20Syntax/#overview-of-the-markdown-syntax","text":"In this section we will go over the basic Markdown syntax that will be needed to edit the existing Markdown templates. For each action, we will attempt to describe two approaches: manual, without utilizing any Obsidian extensions; assisted, where the WYSIWYG editing toolbar is used, together with additional extensions with the end-goal of simplifying the Markdown typing experience. When working on your own learning materials, you are welcome to use whatever approach works best for you. It is also very much possible to take a hybrid approach, writing raw Markdown by hand for some simple aspects, while resorting to extensions for other, more complex tasks (e.g., table formatting). Note that Markdown only defines the syntax for the document formatting, the final visual appearance of the output such as the font size and color is in most cases determined by the design choices of the tool used for converting .md files. The very page that you are currently reading has also been written as a Markdown document which has then been converted to HTML using the MkDocs framework. In this the chosen MkDocs theme has defined that headings will have a blue color, while links will be pink. Of course, if desired, these visual options can also be further customized by modifying the MkDocs configuration.","title":"Overview of the Markdown Syntax"},{"location":"Stage%204%20%E2%80%93%20Produce/09-Content%20Development/09-Markdown%20Syntax/#defining-headings","text":"Headings can be defined by prefixing the line with the # symbol.

During the initial reading this section can be skipped. Linking between learning units or even to specific sections of a given learning unit is a common task when designing learning materials. However, when it comes to complex trainings involving many Markdown files, manually writing the location of the reference document can be an error prone operation. Obsidian has built-in functionality to make the process of linking between Markdown documents easier. For Obsidian to use the appropriate Markdown syntax, ensure that the option Use [[Wikilinks]] is disabled in Obsidian Settings -> Files & Links , as discussed in 08-Development Tools . Whenever a link needs to be inserted, simply press [[ on the keyboard and an Obsidian autocompletion window will open. Search for the title of the desired page to which you would like to link and simply press Enter . By default Obsdiian will enter the page name as the name of the link, but this can be changed by altering the text in the [] brackets. Obsidian can also help with the initial construction of a link to a subsection within a document, but manual changes are needed in this case. To link to an arbitrary heading within a document: open the autocompletion window using [[ find the page that you would like to link to instead of pressing Enter , press the # key Obsidian will open a heading discovery window which you can use to select the appropriate heading Pressing Enter will construct the link One final change needs to be made to the link, since it will not be in the MkDocs expected format. As discussed previously, the full name of the heading which is specified after the # sign should be typed in all lowercase letters where any spaces are replaced by a - .

Having already discovered relevant material for reuse in Stage 2, while also performing a license compatibility check and defining attribution in Stage 3, we are now ready to incorporate the content according to the FAIR-by-Design Methodology. Throughout the activity we assume that you are writing a new course on Open Data and plan to reuse Lesson 5: Planning for Open Data . The following steps will need to be performed: create a lesson plan create an activity create an assessment modify the existing content so that it is compliant to the provided Markdown templates The questions bellow can act as a guide through the above steps. Take a moment to scroll through the document , skimming its content. Is the assumption which was made regarding the content sound, and is it indeed possible to reuse this content in your learning unit? Where can you see its license? Open the GitHub Desktop client and make sure that the local copy of the repository is up-to-date. Open Obsidian. Our goal will be to make a copy of the Learning Unit directory, rename it to an appropriate name, download the original file, and systematically edit the necessary Markdown templates. To copy the Learning Unit directory, expand the navigation tree on the left hand side in Obsidian, and right click on Learning Unit . Choose Show in system explorer . Copy and paste the Learning Unit directory using your file manager, renaming it in the process. A good name is Open Data , but you are of course free to choose. Download the found content into the newly created directory. There are multiple ways in which a file can be downloaded from GitHub. In this case perhaps the simplest one is to choose the Raw option. In the window that opens simply right click and choose the option Save as or Save Page As (the available option depends on the browser being used). Save the file to the newly created directory in Step 4. Make sure to change its name and use an .md extension. Go back to Obsidian and make sure that the file is visible and can be freely edited. Having completed the majority of the technical aspects, we are now ready to follow the Backwards Design Model. Since we already defined a lesson plan in the previous activity, you can move it to the new directory. Verify that the content in it reflects the current scenario. The next step is to define the assessment questions, according to the template provided in the Assessment directory. Having defined the Assessments, describe the Activities that will be undertaken using the assessment_template in the Assessment directory. We are now ready to start working on adapting the downloaded lesson file. Add the necessary metadata in the Markdown heading: title , author , tags . Reorder the existing content, so that the Learning Objectives , Target Audience , Duration , Prerequisites , and Learning Tools sections are filled out. Go over the remaining content and make sure that all headings are defined appropriately. Note that MkDocs supports only one level 1 heading in a given document, so # can be used only once in the Markdown file. Ensure that any linked images are visible. If they are not, download them to the attachments directory, and relink them in the document. Ensure that images have an alt text. Provide attribution to the original document. Next Steps We have edited all of the required files for our new learning unit. The next step would be to verify the changes by uploading the files to GitHub and letting the automated workflow render them to HTML using MkDocs. We will cover this activity in the next section.

Open the GitHub Desktop client and make sure that the local copy of the repository is up-to-date. Open Obsidian. Our goal will be to make a copy of the Learning Unit directory, rename it to an appropriate name, download the original file, and systematically edit the necessary Markdown templates. To copy the Learning Unit directory, expand the navigation tree on the left hand side in Obsidian, and right click on Learning Unit . Choose Show in system explorer . Copy and paste the Learning Unit directory using your file manager, renaming it in the process. A good name is Open Data , but you are of course free to choose. Download the found content into the newly created directory. There are multiple ways in which a file can be downloaded from GitHub. In this case perhaps the simplest one is to choose the Raw option. In the window that opens simply right click and choose the option Save as or Save Page As (the available option depends on the browser being used). Save the file to the newly created directory in Step 4. Make sure to change its name and use an .md extension. Go back to Obsidian and make sure that the file is visible and can be freely edited. Having completed the majority of the technical aspects, we are now ready to follow the Backwards Design Model. Since we already defined a lesson plan in the previous activity, you can move it to the new directory. Verify that the content in it reflects the current scenario. The next step is to define the assessment questions, according to the template provided in the Assessment directory. Having defined the Assessments, describe the Activities that will be undertaken using the assessment_template in the Assessment directory. We are now ready to start working on adapting the downloaded lesson file. Add the necessary metadata in the Markdown heading: title , author , tags . Reorder the existing content, so that the Learning Objectives , Target Audience , Duration , Prerequisites , and Learning Tools sections are filled out. Go over the remaining content and make sure that all headings are defined appropriately. Note that MkDocs supports only one level 1 heading in a given document, so # can be used only once in the Markdown file. Ensure that any linked images are visible. If they are not, download them to the attachments directory, and relink them in the document. Ensure that images have an alt text. Provide attribution to the original document.","title":"Activity: Reusing Existing Content"},{"location":"Stage%204%20%E2%80%93%20Produce/10-Content%20Mix/10-Existing%20Markdown%20Materials%20Reuse/#next-steps","text":"We have edited all of the required files for our new learning unit.

The slide deck should be prepared in an open format so that it is reusable by other trainers. It is best if it is shared with the learners in a PDF format to ensure correct layout when opened with a variety of tools on different platforms. Using a slide deck When developing learning content for self-paced online courses, the HTML content that is obtained from the markdown based learning notebook should be sufficient when combined with all of its attached multimedia. In an instructor led environment where trainers get in touch with the trainees and support their learning process by transferring their knowledge and experience in a physical workshop or online webinar, the learner notebook becomes a supporting material for reference and the main learning content is usually presented in a form of a slide deck further supported with activities and other props. For these types of scenarios the learning materials being developed should include a slide deck per learning unit. Preparing a slide deck The slide deck should be prepared in an open file format to support its reuse by other trainers and instructors. There are a number of options that can be used to create the slide deck in an open format. Here we will briefly cover two options that represent two different approaches to creating a slide deck: Using Power Point and its open pptx format this is a popular representative of the category of tools that enable the creation of highly visually appealing slide decks with lots of advanced features such as smart arts, animations, graphics, etc. Using Quarto and its qmd format that can then be rendered in another format (pptx in our case) this is a popular representative of the category of tools that aim for simple, clean slides focusing on the content, not on its visual appeal this means that if you choose this option and still want visually appealing slides you will then need to put in a lot of additional effort into redesigning the rendered content obtained from the qmd, which makes this choice too complicated and time consuming at the moment. Given that we already covered the importance of rich learning experience and the role that visually appealing learning material plays in the creation of this rich learning experience, we recommend the use of the first option. As it can be seen in the learning materials for this training, we have followed the first option for all lessons, except for this one, where we wanted to show how the slide deck would look like if option no. 2 is chosen. However, it must be stated that the tools belonging to option no. 2 are becoming very popular lately and are rapidly advancing in terms of support for more complex layouts and multimedia integration. Please note, that the use of Google Slides at the moment does not imply using open file format, as their native format of storing the slide deck is not yet open. Power Point Presentations The main reason for using Power Point - like applications for generating the slide deck is their ability to create slides that include very attractive designs and draw the attention of the learner. For these purposes one can use a large set of different features such as: fine alignment of different elements on the slide carefully chosen color palette special slide layouts and designs charts, graphs, smart arts integrated multimedia different fonts and styles custom animations slide transitions etc. When using Power Point for the Skills4EOSC trainings, you should start from the Skills4EOSC template use the Learning_unit_content template to guide you regarding the set and order of slides that the training should have this template has been developed based on the HUNTER model discussed in Stage 3: Design As there is a separate Skills4EOSC training on how to design effective slides, here we will provide just a few tips and tricks on the aspects of Power Point slides design: Follow the 1-6-6 rule there should be only 1 topic per slide use max 6 bullets per topic use max 6 words per bullet note that this rule comes in many varieties were the number 6 is changed to 5 or 7 Implement the Guy Kawasaki 10-20-30 rule your presentation should have max 10 slides per topic you should not need more than 20 mins per topic you should use min 30 pts font size Use the 80-20 rule spend 80% of your time on the visuals of the slide spend 20% of your time on the words on the slide It is recommended that the final slide deck is shared with the learners in a PDF format ensuring that the layout of the slide will not be changed. Quarto Presentations Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that enables the user to write the content in markdown and add dynamic content using Python, R, Julia or Observable. The created QMD document can then be published as an article, presentation, website, blog, or book in many different formats. For the purposes of this learning unit we will be looking into how to use Quarto with Obsidian to publish the content of the QMD document as a pptx file. Getting started with Quarto To work with Quarto you first need to install it. Choose Get Started on its homepage . Install Quarto for your platform. Obsidian does not offer an official plugin to work with Quarto, but there is a community developed plugin that can be used for these purposes. To be able to work with the Quarto QMD files in Obsidian you need to do the following steps: enable community plugins in Obsidian go to settings -> community plugins and choose \"Turn on community plugins\" while in community plugins, go to browse and type \"quarto\" in the search box choose the \"qmd as md\" plugin and install it enable the \"qmd as md\" plugin You are now able to work with qmd files in Obsidian. To create a qmd slide deck, you can start from the template_quarto.qmd that is available in the templates GitHub repository. Copy the file in the learning unit folder where you want to develop your slide deck and then start editing it. The template provides a number of examples of different basic slide layouts that you can use. Creating a slide deck with Quarto To create the title slide for the presentation you need to provide information in the QMD file header. The Quarto rendered will use this information to autogenerate the title slide. The min information that needs to be provided in the header is: title - this is the title of the presentation author - the author of the presentation date - date the presentation was created or last modified format: pptx - tells the renderer that the output should be a Power Point presentation file optional reference-doc: location_and_name_of_template_presentation.pptx - tells the renderer that the provided pptx file should be used as a template for the slides layout. Note that if you use the Skills4EOSC presentation template, only the basic slide layout template is recognised and used, for the other layouts such as title slide, section slide, two content slide, blank slide, etc. the renderer reverts back to default settings and the resulting slide layout is not very usable. The rest of the slides in the slide deck are created based on the following rules: heading 1 - # - is used to mark the title of a section slide heading 2 - ## - is used to mark the title of a regular slide the content of the slide is what comes after the heading The basic slide content can be: simple text - just type the text under the heading 2 title bullets list - use the regular MD notation for bullets numbered list - use the regular MD notation for numbered bullets image - use the regular MD notation for adding an image note that the alt text for the image will appear as image caption in the pptx file use the alt text to write the attribution, if needed table - use the regular MD notation for adding a table If you want to add speaker notes to the slide then you need to provide the text for the speaker notes between a specific set of commands (staring and ending with 3 colons - :::) after a blank line at the end of the slide content definition as: ::: {.notes} this is an example for speaker notes ::: To define the layout of a slide with two contents you need to use the columns command: :::: {.columns} :::{.column width=40%} - this is the content of left column ::: :::{.column width=60%} - this is the content of right column ::: :::: The content of each of the columns can be text, bullets, image, table, etc. An example content of a qmd file is presented in the image below. Render Once the slide content is defined, the installed Quarto engine needs to be used to render it into the defined format, in this case pptx. To do this you need to open a terminal navigate to the folder where you have the qmd file run the command \"quarto render FILENAME.qmd\" There will be output that you can follow to see if Quarto managed to successfully render the slides. The created pptx file will be located in the same folder as the source qmd file. For more information on how to make Power Point presentations using Quarto, refer to the online user guide . Summary In this unit we have learned the basics of Markdown, while continuing on our journey working with the Obsidian and GitHub desktop tools. We have put to use the previously discussed Markdown syntax by creating our very own learning unit along with all of the supporting content that this entails: we wrote a learning plan, defined objectives, assessments, and activities. We also reused existing learning content, adapting it to the FAIR-by-Design templates, and published it as part of the Git book. We also discussed new tools which can be used for creating presentations that can be used to showcase the key points of a learning unit to a given audience. Slide decks are an important tool for instructor led learning. Their content should enrich the learning experience of the learners that follow the training. To improve reuse use an open file format for the slide deck such as Power Point pptx, Quarto qmd or similar. The structure of the slide deck should follow the HUNTER model.

To ensure this the developed content needs to be checked so that access is optimised and all unnecessary barriers are removed making it inclusive and easier to engage with by all learners including people with disabilities.

For digital learning materials and technologies this means that they are accessible if they can be easily used by anyone, including people with disabilities. Accessible digital learning materials need to be designed so that they can be directly used without assistive technology or made usable with assistive technology. These are just a few examples that illustrate the need for accessible materials: simple text structure helps learners with a variety of learning needs, including learners for whom the language used is not their native language simple navigation through the materials should help access the content from mobile devices, as well as learners with low vision adding captions to videos helps learners with hearing impairment as well as learners that have low prior knowledge on the subject and key terminology. General guidelines for development of accessible materials Most of the techniques used for development of accessible learning materials are based on the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) that focuses on the design of learning materials that are aimed to be inclusive of as many learners as possible. This approach, combined with the assistive and accessible technologies, can ensure that every learner has access to the same materials. UDL is based on three fundamental principles: multiple means of representation learning content should be presented in different ways and formats multiple means of action and expression several options for action and expression should support the demonstration of acquired knowledge multiple means of engagement learners differ in what engages and motivates them so multiple options should be provided The following are some general guidelines that should help develop accessible learning content: present the information in multiple ways and formats - this helps support various learning styles and provides alternatives for different impairments use simple language - the materials should be accessible for the learners' varying levels of access, background, and ability an option is to provide additional resources to support learners that have comprehension difficulties use headings - assistive technologies differentiate the structural elements in the text (body text and different levels of headings). These help screen readers process the text correctly. use table of content - helps learners navigate to the required information easily provide alternative text for images - the alternative text is read by the screen reader instead of the image. Decorative images should be marked as decorative so that the screen reader can skip them. use equation editors for math expressions - this format helps screen readers understand the content use a high contrast color palette - high contrast supports learners with vision impairments don't use color as the only way to convey information - provide other alternative means for color blind learners use descriptive links - links to other documents should explain where the link is taking the learner use tables only when required - if a table is truly the best way to convey the information and not just a layout trick, then use column and row headers to describe the content provide closed captions and transcripts - to make the information in the video accessible to the vision impaired. Accessibility standards The European Accessibility Act (Directive 2019/882) requires product and services to be accessible for persons with disabilities, among which web sites and e-books. This also relates to the development of high quality digital learning material. In addition the Digital Education Action Plan (2021-2027) focuses on the development of high-quality, inclusive and accessible digital education in Europe. Therefore it is imperative that the developed learning materials are as accessible as possible according to widely accepted standards. As the learning content created using this training approach will be mostly in HTML, PPTX and PDF format we are going to take a look at some standards that define what is accessible content for these formats. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines international standard The content of this subsection has been adapted from the WCAG 2.1 recommendations by W3C , Copyright \u00a9 2017-2018 W3C\u00ae (MIT, ERCIM, Keio, Beihang). The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) international standard developed by W3C defines how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. As the newest version WCAG 3 is still in its exploratory phase, and the latest version of this standard WCAG 2.2 has just been published in the beginning of October 2023, currently the active version of use is WCAG 2.1 with latest recommendations published in September 2023. Note that W3C always encourages the use of the most recent version of WCAG. The WCAG standards are developed around a number (12-13) of guidelines that are organized under 4 principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. For each of the guidelines there is a defined success criteria that can be tested. The success criteria are defined as three levels: A (low), AA (mid) and AAA (high). In order to meet WCAG, the content needs to meet the success criteria (100%). Note that conformance at higher levels indicates conformance at lower levels. Level A sets a minimum level of accessibility and does not achieve broad accessibility for many situations. For this reason, for the development of FAIR-by-design learning materials we aim to achieve (as much as possible) WCAG 2.1 level AA . WCAG 2.1 define a number of new success criteria across the 4 principles: Perceivable - Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive. Operable - User interface components and navigation must be operable. Understandable - Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable. Robust - Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted by by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. For Level AA conformance, the Web page satisfies all the Level A and Level AA Success Criteria, or a Level AA conforming alternate version is provided. W3C provides a quick reference that describes what is needed in order to achieve conformance. Some of the most important guidelines are as follows: Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language. The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1. Web pages do not contain anything that flashes more than three times in any one second period, or the flash is below the general flash and red flash thresholds. Web pages have titles that describe topic or purpose. The purpose of each link can be determined from the link text alone or from the link text together with its programmatically determined link context, except where the purpose of the link would be ambiguous to users in general. Section headings are used to organize the content. Captions are provided for all prerecorded audio content in synchronized media, except when the media is a media alternative for text and is clearly labeled as such. When the sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning, a correct reading sequence can be programmatically determined. ... PDF/Universal Accessibility standard The content of this subsection is based on the Overview of PDF/UA standard by Accessible Document Solution . Also known as ISO 14289, the PDF/UA standard defines clear normative terms for achieving accessibility for the PDF document format. The main goal of the standard is to enable people independently access all information provided in a PDF document. For these purposes the standard defines the content structure of PDF documents using a so-called tag-tree and how it can be access using assistive technologies. Note that the PDF/UA requirements are complementary to the WCAG 2 success criteria, making them compliant with the requirements. The following are just a few of the technical requirements as set out by the PDF/UA standard: All real (meaningful) content shall be tagged. Artifacts (non-meaningful content) shall not be tagged. The \u201ctag tree\u201d created by the individual tags (representing the document\u2019s content) should be sorted to reflect the document\u2019s logical reading order. All structure types in use shall be standard or mapped to standard A manual check of the document is required to ensure that there is no information conveyed using visual means alone (e.g. contrast, colour etc.), and that there is no flickering, blinking or flashing content. A document title must be given in the metadata. In the Document Properties, the Initial View settings must be set up so that the title (rather than the file name) appears in the window title (under Window Options). Any non-text elements (images, charts, graphs, infographics, logos, etc.) must have corresponding alternative text. Accessibility checking Checking for accessibility of all generated learning content for learners is required if you are following the FAIR-by-design methodology. Most of the success criteria and requirements of the accessibility standards can be programmatically checked using a special tool for these purposes. For the learners' notebook that is produced in an HTML format, the WCAG 2.1 AA conformance needs to be checked and this can be done by using any tool from the Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools List generated by W3C . Make sure that you use the filter on the left hand side to choose your country guidelines in case the developed materials need to follow them as well. Many of the tools listed by W3C are free, however there are also commercial solutions, so use the filter on the left hand side to find the type of tool and license that works for you. Note that when using multiple tools to check the same content, the reports generated by the tools may not be identical, i.e. the tools don't always agree on the accessibility success criteria outcomes. In other words, your web content may be declared as accessible by one tool, but not by another. Thus it is important to state the tool used and the report obtained when declaring that your content is accessible. In addition, the accessibility evaluation tools are not almighty . Thus it is best that a manual inspection is done in addition to the automated inspection using a tool. Some of the tools can even compile a list of the success criteria that require manual inspection . HTML Accessibility Evaluation Although the Chrome browser has a built-in accessibility checking tool as part of the Lighthouse quality assessment tool , this accessibility check is very useful but not fully WCAG 2.1 compliant. It is very useful for dealing with basic accessibility issues of web content especially from styling and layout point of view. To check out Lighthouse you should go to View -> Developer -> Developer Tools. Then choose Lighthouse in the top ribbon of the left window that will be presented. Use the >> to access it. You can choose only to analyze the accessibility category. The analysis is activated with the Analyze page load button. The accessibility checking tool that was used during the development of these learning materials is LERA, which is a free browser plugin for Chrome developed by AdvancedBytez Solutions Inc and released in February 2022. To install the plugin you need to go to the chrome webstore and search for it, or you can use this direct link to install LERA . Once you have LERA installed, in order to use it, all you have to do is open a tab and navigate to the web page that you would like to inspect for accessibility. Then, you choose the LERA plugin from the list of extensions (you can also pin it for easier access) and click on the Automatic Audit button in the form that will appear. A new window will be opened with the report created by LERA where on the dashboard the problems found are categorized in 4 categories: critical, serious, moderate, and minor. In the example shown below, there have been 12 issues discovered related to two types of problems: contrast between foreground and background colors links with discernable text By clicking on the issues you can get more information on where they are, how big their impact is, and a recommendation on how to solve them. You can choose to save the reports for later reference. And if you go to Report on the left hand side you can download the saved reports in a Microsoft Excel format. If you are using the template repo as suggested in this training and are being careful to implement the general guidelines discussed before, there should be no problem to pass the automated audit performed by LERA. Activity Try checking the accessibility of the NASA Transform to Open Science web site using LERA. What are your findings? Do you have a clear idea of what changes are needed in order to pass the audit? Power Point Accessibility The power point presentations created for instructor led trainings should also be checked for accessibility issued. This can be performed by using the integrated tool called Accessibility Checker. Microsoft provides a web tutorial on how to make your PowerPoint presentations accessible to people with disabilities . Within there is a list of best practices that should be followed while designing the presentation: every slide should have a meaningful title include alternative text for all visuals slide content should be read in the intended order descriptive hyperlink text should be used color should not be the only way of conveying information sufficient contrast should be used for text and background color tables should be avoided, or at least be simple with headers font size should be min 18pts sans serif fonts should be used integrated videos should be accessible export the presentation in an accessible format, e.g PDF Although this list of best practices and checks that are implemented in Power Point are very similar to the success criteria defined in WCAG 2.1, it must be mentioned that Power Point does not formally conform to the WCAG 2.1 standard, meaning that if a presentation is deemed accessible by the checker it is not necessarily conformant to WCAG 2.1. The Power Point Accessibility Checker can be activated in Review by choosing Check Accessibility . The tool works in the Accessibility pane on the right hand side. It shows a list of slides that have accessibility issues. Once you select a particular issue it provides recommendations on how to fix it in the bottom of the pane. The usual problems that arise are: not enough contrast small font size missing alternative text Note that you should provide alternative text for every smart art that you use, and any other shape that you add to the slide. For the smart art, the alternative text can be the text from the smart art with some small adjustments. Also, the tool can generate alternative text for you using AI, but it is not very good when it comes to complex images. Keep in mind that if you are using Quarto to develop your presentations, you MUST go through accessibility check in Power Point. Remember that Quarto uses the alternative text provided for an image as caption, so alternative text will need to be added manually for each image in the presentation. Finally, if you are using Mac, then note that the simple use of Save As PDF feature does not create an accessible PDF. You will have to go to Power Point 365 online and open the presentation there and from there choose to export to PDF. With this you will get a PDF file that conforms to the very basic PDF/UA requirements. Activity Check the accessibility of the Power Point presentation on Open Science available on OSF: Intro to Open Science - Panelist Slides for upload 3.3.18 at noon taken from Introduction to Open Science: Nuts & Bolts of Getting Started uploaded by Elizabeth Gilbert . Have you identified all accessibility issues? Are you able to solve them all? PDF accessibility checking tool The best way to ensure PDF accessibility is to use Acrobat Pro that has an integrated accessibility checker. Adobe has published a full guide on creating and verifying PDF accessibility with Acrobat Pro . Acrobat Pro however is a commercial tool that is not accessible to everyone and thus here we provide an alternative that enables you to check the accessibility of created PDF documents. One free option is the axesCheck online tool where you can upload a PDF file and the tool will provide you with a report on the compliance with PDF/UA and WCAG. As it can be seen in the images where an example PDF file has been used, the report provides a high-level overview of the passes and failed requirements. If you want to try and fix the issues you will need to use Acrobat Pro. Or try to go back to the source file from which the PDF was exported and fix some issues there. Note that when exporting a Power Point presentation to PDF on Windows and on Mac, you will get a different output that will produce a different report in the tool. Accessible Power Point presentations (according to the built in checker) are usually converted into a PDF wherein all of the basic requirements for accessibility are fulfilled (as in the image above). This is the minimum that is required for the developed learning materials. Moodle accessibility checks The Skills4EOSC learning platform is based on the Moodle Learning Management System (LMS). If you are going to be adding content directly in the training course on the platform (not just linking to external resources such as the learner's notebook) then you need to make sure you check the accessibility of this content as well. To perform this step you can use the integrated accessibility checker tool that is part of the ribbon of tools available when editing content in Moodle. This is usually the second icon from right to left that looks similar to the vitruvian man, as presented in the image below. Accessibility tips and tricks As the main learning content is being developed in MD, the following are the best practices when it comes to MD accessibility: use headings to outline content provide meaningful alternative text for images use descriptive text for links use plain language For tip on how to write alternative text for images study the Alternative text guide by WebAIM . The key takeaways in the guide include: alternative text should be accurate and equivalent in representing content and function alternative text should be succinct alternative text should not be redundant alternative text should not include phrases such as \"image of ...\" or \"graphic of ...\" Decorative images should have blank alternative text. A decorative image is an image that does not present important content is used for layout or non-informative purposes does not have a function (e.g. is not a link) When dealing with colors and layouts, there are online tools that can help experiment with color combinations. One such example is the Elements must have sufficient color contrast checking tool developed by Deque University. Using this tool you can check if you satisfy the AA or AAA levels for WCAG 2.1. When you are reusing existing learning material, make sure to check the accessibility of this material as well. If there are any issues they should be fixed. Accessibility statement If you are fully committed to accessibility and your complete web site provides accessible content, then you should develop an accessibility statement wherein you will provide details about your accessibility efforts. The accessibility statement is usually presented as a link on the homepage that leads to separate accessibility policy page. There are many accessibility statement templates online that can be used to generate the accessibility statement. One of the best tools is the policy development guide developed by W3C: Developing an Accessibility Statement that defines all sections and information that should be present in the statement. It also offers a generator tool that will guide you through the steps and help you create your accessibility statement including all important aspects such as: mission measures to support accessibility conformance status feedback gathering compatibility technical specification limitations and alternatives assessment approach evaluation report and statement complaints response The site also provides an Example of Complete Accessibility Statement . Given that the learning materials that are to be developed within the Skills4EOSC project may need to conform to different country regulations and standards, and taking into account the inability to ensure PDF/UA compliance and WCAG compliance of the PPTX content, the approach to accessibility of the developed learning materials is best effort. This approach is stated within the accessibility mission provided in the syllabus. Summary Checking and ensuring accessibility as much as possible using available tools and best practices is a requirement when aiming to achieve accessibility for FAIR learning materials. It is important to adhere to standards such as the WCAG, but also follow the recommendations and rules defined on the country level. There are many options for using a WCAG accessibility checking tool, many of them freely available, and many editing tools and software such as Power Point come with integrated Accessibility Checkers that help produce inclusive learning materials starting from the design stage.

Accessible digital learning materials need to be designed so that they can be directly used without assistive technology or made usable with assistive technology. These are just a few examples that illustrate the need for accessible materials: simple text structure helps learners with a variety of learning needs, including learners for whom the language used is not their native language simple navigation through the materials should help access the content from mobile devices, as well as learners with low vision adding captions to videos helps learners with hearing impairment as well as learners that have low prior knowledge on the subject and key terminology.","title":"Accessible learning materials"},{"location":"Stage%204%20%E2%80%93%20Produce/11-Accessibility/11-Checking_accessibility/#general-guidelines-for-development-of-accessible-materials","text":"Most of the techniques used for development of accessible learning materials are based on the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) that focuses on the design of learning materials that are aimed to be inclusive of as many learners as possible. This approach, combined with the assistive and accessible technologies, can ensure that every learner has access to the same materials. UDL is based on three fundamental principles: multiple means of representation learning content should be presented in different ways and formats multiple means of action and expression several options for action and expression should support the demonstration of acquired knowledge multiple means of engagement learners differ in what engages and motivates them so multiple options should be provided The following are some general guidelines that should help develop accessible learning content: present the information in multiple ways and formats - this helps support various learning styles and provides alternatives for different impairments use simple language - the materials should be accessible for the learners' varying levels of access, background, and ability an option is to provide additional resources to support learners that have comprehension difficulties use headings - assistive technologies differentiate the structural elements in the text (body text and different levels of headings). These help screen readers process the text correctly. use table of content - helps learners navigate to the required information easily provide alternative text for images - the alternative text is read by the screen reader instead of the image. Decorative images should be marked as decorative so that the screen reader can skip them. use equation editors for math expressions - this format helps screen readers understand the content use a high contrast color palette - high contrast supports learners with vision impairments don't use color as the only way to convey information - provide other alternative means for color blind learners use descriptive links - links to other documents should explain where the link is taking the learner use tables only when required - if a table is truly the best way to convey the information and not just a layout trick, then use column and row headers to describe the content provide closed captions and transcripts - to make the information in the video accessible to the vision impaired.","title":"General guidelines for development of accessible materials"},{"location":"Stage%204%20%E2%80%93%20Produce/11-Accessibility/11-Checking_accessibility/#accessibility-standards","text":"The European Accessibility Act (Directive 2019/882) requires product and services to be accessible for persons with disabilities, among which web sites and e-books.

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) international standard developed by W3C defines how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. As the newest version WCAG 3 is still in its exploratory phase, and the latest version of this standard WCAG 2.2 has just been published in the beginning of October 2023, currently the active version of use is WCAG 2.1 with latest recommendations published in September 2023. Note that W3C always encourages the use of the most recent version of WCAG. The WCAG standards are developed around a number (12-13) of guidelines that are organized under 4 principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. For each of the guidelines there is a defined success criteria that can be tested. The success criteria are defined as three levels: A (low), AA (mid) and AAA (high). In order to meet WCAG, the content needs to meet the success criteria (100%). Note that conformance at higher levels indicates conformance at lower levels. Level A sets a minimum level of accessibility and does not achieve broad accessibility for many situations. For this reason, for the development of FAIR-by-design learning materials we aim to achieve (as much as possible) WCAG 2.1 level AA . WCAG 2.1 define a number of new success criteria across the 4 principles: Perceivable - Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive. Operable - User interface components and navigation must be operable. Understandable - Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable. Robust - Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted by by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. For Level AA conformance, the Web page satisfies all the Level A and Level AA Success Criteria, or a Level AA conforming alternate version is provided. W3C provides a quick reference that describes what is needed in order to achieve conformance. Some of the most important guidelines are as follows: Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language. The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1. Web pages do not contain anything that flashes more than three times in any one second period, or the flash is below the general flash and red flash thresholds. Web pages have titles that describe topic or purpose. The purpose of each link can be determined from the link text alone or from the link text together with its programmatically determined link context, except where the purpose of the link would be ambiguous to users in general. Section headings are used to organize the content. Captions are provided for all prerecorded audio content in synchronized media, except when the media is a media alternative for text and is clearly labeled as such.

The accessibility statement is usually presented as a link on the homepage that leads to separate accessibility policy page. There are many accessibility statement templates online that can be used to generate the accessibility statement. One of the best tools is the policy development guide developed by W3C: Developing an Accessibility Statement that defines all sections and information that should be present in the statement. It also offers a generator tool that will guide you through the steps and help you create your accessibility statement including all important aspects such as: mission measures to support accessibility conformance status feedback gathering compatibility technical specification limitations and alternatives assessment approach evaluation report and statement complaints response The site also provides an Example of Complete Accessibility Statement . Given that the learning materials that are to be developed within the Skills4EOSC project may need to conform to different country regulations and standards, and taking into account the inability to ensure PDF/UA compliance and WCAG compliance of the PPTX content, the approach to accessibility of the developed learning materials is best effort.

While editing the main content of syllabus file in Obsidian ensure that any changes or adaptations you have done during the iterative process of development of learning units is reflected in the final content of the syllabus. Remember that the syllabus contains all fields defined with the RDA minimal metadata schema thus providing all required information in a human-readable format. Now it is time to provide the same information in a machine-readable format. For these purposes you need to edit the metadata of the syllabus md file. The metadata portion of the file is at the top of the document between the set of ---. It consists of a list of keywords and values where each keyword represents a field from the RDA minimal metadata schema. Note that # is used to represent a comment, and that the first three keywords are named a little bit differently (tags are keywords) so that they are compliant with the md metadata standards and recognised by the system that generates the web content. Fields that have one value only, should have that value represented between quotation marks. For fields that can have multiple values, each value is supplied in a separate row using 4 spaces and - in front. Don't mix spaces and tabs as this will break the format and the content will not be machine parsable.

The internal QA can be performed by the same people that have done the development. If the work has been done collaboratively, it is preferred that the checks are done in such a way that the person that checks the learning unit is not the same person that developed the learning unit. This approach will improve the chance of catching some small bugs and errors. The overall check of structure and presence of all required elements should be done by the main collaborator. The checks of authorship, citation and similar should be done by all collaborators. Required elements The internal QA should start with an initial sweep that will check if the hierarchical structure of the learning content is correct and all learning units have been fully developed. The easiest way to perform this step is to check the Table of Content (TOC) of the learner's notebook (Git Book) and see if the structure matches the design. Next, an overall check should be done to identify if all required elements (files) are present. For these purposes the following checklist can be used: Root folder [ X ] Syllabus [ X ] Facilitation Guide [ X ] LICENSE [ X ] Feedback form resources folder [ X ] Section folders [ X ] Module folders [ X ] Learning Unit folders for each Learning Unit folder [ X ] Activities [ X ] Assessment [ X ] Learning Plan [ X ] Learning Content [ X ] Slide Deck (if instructor-led) Note: We assume that you have not changed any of the rest of the files in the Templates repo that was cloned in the beginning.

Most of what is described in this unit has already been mentioned previously, but this page should act as a reference for any future environment setups. Learning Objectives Recognize the need for a GitHub organization when collaborating with others Differentiate between organization level and repository level repository permissions Use the GitHub web portal to add collaborators to an existing organization or repository Solve potential change conflicts arising when multiple authors make changes to the same file concurrently Target Audience Attendees of the FAIR-by-Design ToT live webinar Duration 15 mins Prerequisites All previous units in the Stage 4: Produce , including 13-Internal QA . Learning Tools Training BBB room Obsidian Preparing the Collaborative Environment The following steps are to be followed by a single contributor who will establish the GitHub organization, fork the templates Git repository, and then invite all remaining collaborators. Once granted access, the collaborators will simply need to clone the new repository and start working on the materials themselves. We assume that general knowledge of Git terminology and access to previously discussed software tools including GitHub Desktop and Obsidian. Login to GitHub and create a new organization by clicking on your profile picture in the top right corner and selecting Your Organizations . Initiate the new organization wizard by clicking on the New organization button. You will be asked to select a GitHub plan for your new organization. The Free plan includes everything that might be needed for the development of FAIR-by-Design learning materials, including hosting of a Git book. The Free plan is equivalent to the Team plan when it comes to public repositories, so that is what we will be using shortly. Choose the Free plan by clicking on the Create a free organization button . Enter the organization name and contact email. If desired, search and add collaborators to the organization. There is always an option to add additional collaborators at a later stage. An important distinction that needs to be made is between collaborators at the organization level and collaborators at the repository level. If you plan to develop multiple distinct FAIR-by-Design courses, each in its own repository, with perhaps a different set of collaborators, then per-repository collaborators are the right choice for you. Repository level collaborators only have access to a single repository, which is in contrast to organization level collaborators which have access to all existing and future repositories part of a given organization. Make a decision on your collaborators' strategy and if needed, invite the respective organization level collaborators now by either entering their GitHub username or email address. If no organization level collaborators need to be added at this moment, choose Skip this step . After a couple of moments your organization will be created and you will be redirected to its homepage. Make sure that the organization's visibility is set to Public using the dropdown menu in the top right corner. If at any point in time additional organization level collaborators need to be added, this task can be accomplished from the People page, using the Invite member button. The next step is to fork the templates repository under the new organization. Navigate to the templates homepage, and click on the Fork button. Using the repository forking wizard, make sure to select the newly created organization as the repository owner. Enter a desired name for the new repository and provide an optional description. After a few brief moments the forking process will complete and you will be redirected to the homepage of the newly created repository. Repository level collaborators can be added at this point using the Settings -> Collaborators and teams page. At this point all collaborators will get an email notification alerting them of their new role within the organization/repository. They can proceed by cloning the repository using the GitHub Desktop software, as discussed in 08-Introduction to Markdown and Git . Stepping away from technical matters for a moment, it is best if you take a moment to discuss with your collaborators who will be working on what learning units, dividing responsibilities as to avoid any potential conflicts. If Git conflicts (called merge conflicts) do happen, read the Advanced: Resolving Git Conflicts section below to learn how to resolve them. As a final step, make sure that the automated workflow will have the necessary permission to build the Git book by navigating to your organizations homepage, then choosing Settings -> Actions -> General . Scroll down until the Workflow permissions section becomes visible. Choose Read and write permissions and save the changes. Advanced: Resolving Git Conflicts One of the best Git features is its ability to provide users an easy way of resolving change conflicts. A change conflict occurs when two (or more) users simultaneously edit the same portion of a given file, and then try to commit it. Note that if distinct parts of the same file are edited, and there are no conflicting changes, then Git is able to merge the changes automatically, without requiring a user intervention. A user intervention is required only when Git is not capable of reconciling the changes, and the user is asked for an input on what changes to keep and what changes to discard. In case a change conflict does occur, Git will explicitly mark all conflicting changes in the file, allowing the user to resolve them on a case-by-case basis, and then commit the latest version of the file again. Such advanced change conflict features are only available on plain text formats, such as .md , .txt , or source code files. Binary files such as .docx or .pptx cannot have conflicts resolved with the help of Git. Let's look at an example under what conditions a change conflict can occur and how to resolve it. We assume that two contributors, Bob and Alice, want to collaborate in a single repository. Both Bob and Alice start by updating the syllabus.md file, and they both change the metadata in the Markdown header. Bob manages to commit the changes first and pushes them to the upstream repository. When Alice is satisfied with her changes, and tries to commit and push them, she received the following error message: As discussed in previous sections, this message does not necessarily mean that there is a change conflict that will require manual intervention. Maybe the changes are made do distinct, non-overlapping, parts of the files, so let's fetch (download) them. After fetching, we have the option of applying the changes using the Pull origin button. At this point, if the changes are indeed in conflict with one-another, we will be presented with an error message such as the one shown below. The Continue merge button will remain deactivated until all conflicts are manually resolved. Let's get back to Obsidian and see the state of our syllabus.md file. Notice the two code blocks which have been selected using orange and blue boxes respectively. The orange block, starting with <<<<<<< HEAD is the change that Alice has done (the local change). The change denoted by the block starting with ======= and ending with >>>>>>>> is the remote change (done by Bob), identified by the unique change number, fcb... . Now it is up to Alice do decide how to proceed. She can either discard her own change (removing the content in the orange box), discard Bob's change (removing the content in the blue box), or do a manual merge. Let's assume that Alice opts to do a manual merge. After editing the file, it will look similar to what is shown in the figure below. Note that the extra lines containing characters such as >>>>> , ===== , <<<<<< which were used to denote the start and end of the conflicting changes have been manually removed. Going back to GitHub Desktop, we can see that the change conflict has been resolved, and we are ready to continue. In the background clicking on the Continue merge button will automatically commit our changes, so the only thing remaining now is to push these changes to GitHub. Key Takeaways It is important to have a well-defined and clear development workflow when collaborating with multiple contributors on learning materials. Nonetheless, conflicting changes can happen in the real world, and Git with its robust change tracking can help resolve such situations. An important thing to keep in mind is that conflict resolution only works on text-based file formats, such as Markdown, which can also be seen as an additional advantage to using this open format for learning material production.","title":"Team Collaboration"},{"location":"Stage%204%20%E2%80%93%20Produce/14-Team%20Collaboration/14-Team%20Collaboration/#team-collaboration","text":"Before starting work on the production on actual FAIR-by-Design learning materials, it is worth reiterating all of the steps which are advised in order to ensure a seamless collaboration environment with multiple contributors.

Once granted access, the collaborators will simply need to clone the new repository and start working on the materials themselves. We assume that general knowledge of Git terminology and access to previously discussed software tools including GitHub Desktop and Obsidian. Login to GitHub and create a new organization by clicking on your profile picture in the top right corner and selecting Your Organizations . Initiate the new organization wizard by clicking on the New organization button. You will be asked to select a GitHub plan for your new organization. The Free plan includes everything that might be needed for the development of FAIR-by-Design learning materials, including hosting of a Git book. The Free plan is equivalent to the Team plan when it comes to public repositories, so that is what we will be using shortly. Choose the Free plan by clicking on the Create a free organization button . Enter the organization name and contact email. If desired, search and add collaborators to the organization. There is always an option to add additional collaborators at a later stage. An important distinction that needs to be made is between collaborators at the organization level and collaborators at the repository level. If you plan to develop multiple distinct FAIR-by-Design courses, each in its own repository, with perhaps a different set of collaborators, then per-repository collaborators are the right choice for you. Repository level collaborators only have access to a single repository, which is in contrast to organization level collaborators which have access to all existing and future repositories part of a given organization. Make a decision on your collaborators' strategy and if needed, invite the respective organization level collaborators now by either entering their GitHub username or email address. If no organization level collaborators need to be added at this moment, choose Skip this step . After a couple of moments your organization will be created and you will be redirected to its homepage. Make sure that the organization's visibility is set to Public using the dropdown menu in the top right corner. If at any point in time additional organization level collaborators need to be added, this task can be accomplished from the People page, using the Invite member button. The next step is to fork the templates repository under the new organization. Navigate to the templates homepage, and click on the Fork button. Using the repository forking wizard, make sure to select the newly created organization as the repository owner. Enter a desired name for the new repository and provide an optional description. After a few brief moments the forking process will complete and you will be redirected to the homepage of the newly created repository. Repository level collaborators can be added at this point using the Settings -> Collaborators and teams page. At this point all collaborators will get an email notification alerting them of their new role within the organization/repository. They can proceed by cloning the repository using the GitHub Desktop software, as discussed in 08-Introduction to Markdown and Git . Stepping away from technical matters for a moment, it is best if you take a moment to discuss with your collaborators who will be working on what learning units, dividing responsibilities as to avoid any potential conflicts. If Git conflicts (called merge conflicts) do happen, read the Advanced: Resolving Git Conflicts section below to learn how to resolve them. As a final step, make sure that the automated workflow will have the necessary permission to build the Git book by navigating to your organizations homepage, then choosing Settings -> Actions -> General . Scroll down until the Workflow permissions section becomes visible. Choose Read and write permissions and save the changes.","title":"Preparing the Collaborative Environment"},{"location":"Stage%204%20%E2%80%93%20Produce/14-Team%20Collaboration/14-Team%20Collaboration/#advanced-resolving-git-conflicts","text":"One of the best Git features is its ability to provide users an easy way of resolving change conflicts. A change conflict occurs when two (or more) users simultaneously edit the same portion of a given file, and then try to commit it. Note that if distinct parts of the same file are edited, and there are no conflicting changes, then Git is able to merge the changes automatically, without requiring a user intervention. A user intervention is required only when Git is not capable of reconciling the changes, and the user is asked for an input on what changes to keep and what changes to discard. In case a change conflict does occur, Git will explicitly mark all conflicting changes in the file, allowing the user to resolve them on a case-by-case basis, and then commit the latest version of the file again. Such advanced change conflict features are only available on plain text formats, such as .md , .txt , or source code files. Binary files such as .docx or .pptx cannot have conflicts resolved with the help of Git. Let's look at an example under what conditions a change conflict can occur and how to resolve it. We assume that two contributors, Bob and Alice, want to collaborate in a single repository. Both Bob and Alice start by updating the syllabus.md file, and they both change the metadata in the Markdown header.

Although the use of MD entails lots of additional automated steps such as publishing to Zenodo and easy integration with the learning platform, you can still produce FAIR learning materials using other open file formats. In this part we will go through one alternative scenario that replaces the use of the Templates repository and MD file formats with Workplace and Microsoft Office Word open file format. Learning Objectives Adapt to using other file formats Assess pros and cons of alternative approach Target Audience attendees of the FAIR-by-Design ToT live webinar Duration 20 mins Prerequisites Completed 12-Content Finalisation Learning Tools Training BBB room Browser Win some, lose some As discussed at the beginning of this stage, the use of markdown is recommended as it allows instructional designers to focus on content, and not worry much about the final layout of the learning materials as the produced GitBook already has a defined style that will be seamlessly replicated. This leads to development of uniform learning materials where the main focus and attention is put on the quality of the content. This approach alleviates many headaches of the produce and publish process such as: no need to follow special layout rules and styles to ensure uniform look and feel of the learning materials across learning units no need to test and fix any accessibility issues related to the choice of color palette or font style and size auto generation of the learners' notebook in the form of a Git Book with integrated multimedia content highly dynamic collaborative environment that can easily be extended to external collaborators very detailed version control that extended to the very content of each file automated workflow for publishing the learning materials to Zenodo and obtaining a DOI machine-readable metadata available ... In addition, the level of reusability of the produced material is very high, as the content can be reused in an environment with a completely different layout styles and rules with no, to very little changes. Because when it comes to reuse, it is the content that matters, not the layout. Switching to using DOCX files instead of MD files is going to transfer the responsibility for all implemented and automated features to the instructional designers . This means that the instructional designer will need to take care of: implementing uniform styling and layout ensuring the styling and layout choices are fully accessible according to WCAG 2.1 seamless integration of multimedia in the learning content manual generation of the final learners content (preferably HTML to accommodate for integrated multimedia) transferring to a public collaborative environment before publishing to support external collaborators manual publication of the learning materials to Zenodo no machine-readable metadata available ... DOCX alternative setup How to proceed if you want to work with Microsoft Office open file formats (docx, pptx) while developing the learning content avoiding the use of markdown? Use the Skills4EOSC Workplace as an initial location for the internal development of the learning materials note: workplace documents can not be shared with non project members Recreate the hierarchical folder structure to logically organise your documents Create a docx template which will act as an alternative for each md template file syllabus facilitator guide feedback form for each learning unit plan content activity description note that quizzes must stay in their GIFT plaintext format for import to the learning platform Copy all fields defined in each md template to the corresponding docx template Style each docx template using the Skills4EOSC logo, color palette and funding information Ensure the created templates are accessible export to HTML use a WCAG 2.1 checking tool Distribute the templates in their right place in your hierarchical folder structure Add the correct LICENSE plaintext file in the root of your folder structure You are now ready to start developing the learning content using the same basic guidelines and principles as discussed previously. Don't forget that you will need to export to HTML (or PDF if only static multimedia is used) and then double check for accessibility. Don't keep the exported HTML in the same folder tree as the editable content. Once the internal QA is completed, you will need to ensure that the correct final up-to-date version of the exported HTML is used for its publication on the learning platform as this is now a fully manual process. When the final content is available on the course on the learning platform, it is time to put it into a public repository so that it can be offered for external collaboration: Create a new repository on GitHub or you can delete the MD stuff from the cloned template repository and replace it with the new content Copy paste ALL files and folders from workplace to the repository Commit and push the changes Double check on GitHub that the repository is a cloned image of your initial workplace structure Delete or archive the workplace content (this should not be used any longer as the GitHub repository took over this role) From now on, any changes in the learning materials must be done directly on the GitHub repository. We don't recommend using a GitHub repository for work with Office only files from the start as this will create a lot of conflicts and requests for conflict resolution and merging, especially when more people are working on the same document. GitHub looks at all Office files as binary objects and can not keep track of the changes done within the object as it does with md files. I'm looking for yet another alternative, what now You can choose any open file format instead of DOCX. Take care that at the moment Google file formats are not strictly considered as open, so this choice is not recommended as a viable option. The procedure would be very similar to the one described above, only a little bit adjusted to the format of your choice. Sometimes other options, such as the development of SCORM based learning materials for an example, create more files in the place of a single md or docx file. In this case keep all of these files grouped together in a folder for easier building of the hierarchical logical structure. What can not be considered as an alternative learning content Developing only a slide deck with notes in the slides can not be considered as an alternative for the development of the learners' notebook. The main issue is that the slide notes can not convey the necessary level of information in a multi modal way. Their primary use is support for the trainers that give the presentation, not the learners that acquire the knowledge. Summary The use of Obsidian and/or markdown as the primary file format for developing learning content is only a strong recommendation and not a requirement of the FAIR-by-Design methodology.

All of the steps discussed below will need to be manually executed only once , upon the first publishing of the materials. Closely following the provided instructions is very important before moving forward with the actual depositing on Zenodo which is handled by automatic workflows, as discussed in 17-Zenodo Publishing Files Description The FAIR-by-Design templates repository contains the accompanying files which we will need to alter: CITATION.cff README.md CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md RELEASE_NOTES.md These files can be altered in any order desired, as long as making sure that they have all been covered. Starting from CITATION.cff , the purpose of this file is to provide information on how the Git repository can be cited. Its content, among other things, also controls the text shown when the Cite this repository button is clicked on the right hand side of a GitHub repository's homepage. It is written in a YAML format and has controlled vocabularies for most of the supported fields. Luckily, validators are also widely available, and we will discuss some options in this space in the Activity, below. README.md is a Markdown file which should briefly describe the repository, so that first time visitors can get an initial idea what it is about. The README.md file's content is shown immediately below the directory browser on the repository's homepage. The CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md , as its name suggests, describes the contributors' code of conduct which needs to be adhered to. It defines standards for how to engage in a community. It can also contain steps for resoling issues between members of the community. GitHub also shows a direct link to a repository's code of conduct (if available) above the citation information. RELEASE_NOTES.md is a special Markdown file that keeps provides description of all the changes made to the material since its first release. The content of this file is embedded as is on the Git book homepage (the syllabus) in a collapsible block. In the activity that follows we will go over all of the required changes that need to be made to these files, along with tips, and any potential pit-falls when it comes to controlled vocabulary fields. Activity: Publishing Preparation in Practice - Customizing Accompanying Files Setting up the Environment Make sure that the latest changes have been pulled from the remote using the GitHub Desktop application Open the Obsidian workspace Ensure that all three files are already available (as a result of forking the templates repository previously) in the root of the repository: CITATION.cff , README.md , CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md . Filling out CITATION.cff Click on CITATION.cff in Obsidian's file tree pane. In some environments Obsidian might not be able to automatically open the file since it has an unsupported extension - .cff . If so, select a preferred text editor which is already installed on your system (e.g., Notepad on Microsoft Windows). Fill out the appropriate information in the following fields: authors - a list of authors who participated in the creation of the learning materials title - title of the training abstract - a short abstract describing the learning materials license (if a license other than the default CC-BY should be used) license-url (if a license other than the default CC-BY should be used) keywords - list of keywords which describe the learning materials repository - the URL to the GitHub repository where the materials are hosted While filling out the file and adding new lines, make sure that they match the indentation of the examples. The picture below provides a visual example of how to correctly add a new author. The newly added author (an imaginary John Doe) should have the same indentation (number of spaces at the beginning of the line) as the first author which is given as an example in the template. Inconsistent number of spaces will make the CITATION.cff file invalid. Additionally, we denote that we are adding information about a new author by prefixing the first property (in this case family-names ) with a - character. Note that any other fields also present in the CITATION.cff file such as: version , doi , date-released should not be manually edited . They will be updated automatically when publishing the repository to Zenodo. After having done the necessary updates to the fields, you can validate the structure of the CITATION.cff file using the free online utility which is available on citation-file-format.github.io . Paste the content into the text field Press the PARSE button Ignore any warnings about \"extra\" fields. It is important that a message stating Parsed CFF successfully appears. In case there is a validation error, a descriptive error message will be shown, pointing to the line that is incorrectly formatted. Assuming that the correct indentation policy is not followed when specifying the first name of an author, the error message will be: Save the changes made to the CITATION.cff file and close the text editor. Filling out README.md Go back to Obsidian and open the README.md file by clicking on its name from the left-hand directory tree. The content of the README.md file is free text, so you are welcome to provide any introduction that you would like. Just make sure to keep the official Skills4EOSC header image, and a reference to the templates repository. Filling out CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md The CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file, as present in the templates repository is a generic text that can be applied to any future trainings. Go over the text and make any desired changes. Make sure to alter the contact information for the person responsible for the enforcement of the code of conduct rules, specified in the Enforcement section. Filling out RELEASE_NOTES.md Open the RELEASE_NOTES.md file by clicking on its name from the left-hand directory tree. The file uses a special Markdown syntax which allows its contents to be shown as collapsed on the syllabus home page, thus preserving space. For the initial release, alter the text below the 1.0.0 heading and make sure to also update the date of the release in the heading itself. For all subsequent releases, add a new level two heading using two hash symbols on a new line, ( ## ) just below <summary>Release Notes</summary> . Ideally, the RELEASE_NOTES.md file should list the various versions in a descending order, sorted by the release date. Committing Changes Once the three files have been updated, commit the changes and push them to GitHub using the GitHub Desktop application. Upon every change of the CITATION.cff file an automated action is executed which verifies its contents. In case of a validation error, you will receive an email message similar to the one shown below. The recommended action in such cases is to simply retry the validation of the CITATION.cff file manually using the citation-file-format.github.io tool. Make sure to address any errors, committing and pushing the results to GitHub once completed. Key Takeaways We have manually prepared all of the necessary metadata required for a successful first publishing of the created learning materials.

Starting from CITATION.cff , the purpose of this file is to provide information on how the Git repository can be cited. Its content, among other things, also controls the text shown when the Cite this repository button is clicked on the right hand side of a GitHub repository's homepage. It is written in a YAML format and has controlled vocabularies for most of the supported fields. Luckily, validators are also widely available, and we will discuss some options in this space in the Activity, below. README.md is a Markdown file which should briefly describe the repository, so that first time visitors can get an initial idea what it is about. The README.md file's content is shown immediately below the directory browser on the repository's homepage. The CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md , as its name suggests, describes the contributors' code of conduct which needs to be adhered to. It defines standards for how to engage in a community. It can also contain steps for resoling issues between members of the community. GitHub also shows a direct link to a repository's code of conduct (if available) above the citation information. RELEASE_NOTES.md is a special Markdown file that keeps provides description of all the changes made to the material since its first release. The content of this file is embedded as is on the Git book homepage (the syllabus) in a collapsible block. In the activity that follows we will go over all of the required changes that need to be made to these files, along with tips, and any potential pit-falls when it comes to controlled vocabulary fields.","title":"Files Description"},{"location":"Stage%205%20%E2%80%93%20Publish/16-Publishing%20Preparations/16-Publishing%20Preparations/#activity-publishing-preparation-in-practice-customizing-accompanying-files","text":"","title":"Activity: Publishing Preparation in Practice - Customizing Accompanying Files"},{"location":"Stage%205%20%E2%80%93%20Publish/16-Publishing%20Preparations/16-Publishing%20Preparations/#setting-up-the-environment","text":"Make sure that the latest changes have been pulled from the remote using the GitHub Desktop application Open the Obsidian workspace Ensure that all three files are already available (as a result of forking the templates repository previously) in the root of the repository: CITATION.cff , README.md , CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md .","title":"Setting up the Environment"},{"location":"Stage%205%20%E2%80%93%20Publish/16-Publishing%20Preparations/16-Publishing%20Preparations/#filling-out-citationcff","text":"Click on CITATION.cff in Obsidian's file tree pane.

The picture below provides a visual example of how to correctly add a new author. The newly added author (an imaginary John Doe) should have the same indentation (number of spaces at the beginning of the line) as the first author which is given as an example in the template. Inconsistent number of spaces will make the CITATION.cff file invalid. Additionally, we denote that we are adding information about a new author by prefixing the first property (in this case family-names ) with a - character.

These workflows are generic and also apply to any forks, without the need for any manual changes. In a nutshell, the actions performed by these workflows are: validate the metadata information provided in CITATION.cff and update the fields which are automatically managed ( doi , version , date-released ) implement Signposting Level 1 compliance, leveraging the existing RDA metadata fields and automatically enriching them, as needed.

Activity: Creating a Draft Deposit on Zenodo The goal of this activity is to describe the way in which the automated publishing workflow is triggered and to verify the resulting Zenodo draft. Notice: Feel free to follow these steps without any hesitation. The workflow will only create a draft deposit on Zenodo, meaning that it will not be publicly published without your explicit approval which can be given from the Zenodo web interface. Double-checking whether the Workflows Configuration Make sure that the workflows which have been copied from the upstream templates repository during the forking process are indeed enabled. i. Visit the homepage of the fork ii. Navigate to the Actions tab iii. If there is a big green button for enabling the copied workflows, click it. If the green button is missing and instead a list of available workflows is shown on the left-hand side of the screen, it means that the workflows have been enabled as required as part of the previous learning units. The image below shows an example list of available workflows which should be shown once they have been enabled. Authorizing the Workflows to Use Zenodo In order for the automated actions to be able to create a draft Zenodo deposit, we must generate an authentication token. Navigate to Zenodo and register a new account or login with an existing one. Once logged in, click on the dropdown menu next to the profile button and select Applications . In the Personal access tokens section click on the New token button. Enter an arbitrary name for the token and make sure to only check the deposit:write checkbox in the Scopes section. Click on Create . Copy the generated access token shown in red. We will need it in a moment. Please note that the token itself is sensitive information, so make sure not to share it with anyone else. Go back to the homepage of your GitHub repository. Click on the Settings tab. Click on Secrets and variables -> Actions in the navigation menu on the left. Click on the New repository secret button. Enter ZENODO_ACCESS_TOKEN as the name and the copied value from previously as the Secret value. Save the new secret using the Add secret button. Creating the Very First Zenodo Deposit We are now ready to initiate the automated workflow for submitting the first draft deposit to Zenodo. Navigate to the homepage of the Git repository. On the right-hand side click on the Releases section. Click on the Create a new release button. Click on the Choose a tag dropdown. Enter the desired version number (e.g., 1.0.0). Make sure to use three numbers, as per the Semantic Versioning specification . The first number (also known as major version number) should be incremented in case of major changes or a complete rewrite of the material. The second number (also known as the minor version number) should be incremented when smaller changes are made, such as extending existing learning units with additional content, or adding a new learning unit. The third and last number (also known as the patch version number) should be incremented when the changes do not directly impact the learning content itself and are constrained to technical changes such as fixing typos, adding references, or improving formatting. Click on the Create new tag: 1.0.0 on publish option. Enter the same version number in the Release title field. Provide an optional description in the Describe this release field. This is a free-text field, so you are free to enter whatever text you would like. Create the release by clicking the Publish release button. At this moment the automatic publishing workflow will be triggered. You can follow its progress from the Actions page. Wait until a green checkmark appears next to the latest entry in the Actions list. In case of any errors you will receive an email message. Verifying the Zenodo Deposit Once the workflow has been successfully executed, it is time to verify the changes that it has made to the repository, together with the uploaded draft deposit on Zenodo. Navigate to the Git book homepage, and check the cite footer. Note that the citing information has been updated and it now references the latest published version, as well as the correct DOI. Notice that at the top of the Git book homepage the version dropdown includes a new version - 1.0.0 . This is a point-in-time freeze of the content of the repository as it appeared at the time of the release. Any future changes will not be applied to the 1.0.0 version of the Git book and will instead be reflected only in latest . Verify that the correct DOI appears on the landing (syllabus) page of the Git book. Using the GitHub Desktop client pull the remote changes which have been committed and pushed during the workflow's execution. Open any PowerPoint presentation at random. Navigate to the last slide. Verify that the citing information correctly references a new DOI. Navigate to Zenodo and click on the Upload button in the header, next to the search bar. You will be presented by a draft deposit of your Git repository. Note that this draft deposit is still not publicly accessible, but has a DOI pre-reserved which has not been activated. Click on the deposit's name. Verify that all metadata has been correctly transferred from the Git repository. Note that you will not be able to make any changes to the deposit once published. Pay special attention to the associated Zenodo community, authors, license, and funding information. Important: The only manual change that needs to be performed is to enter the correct language in the Language field. When satisfied with the deposit's metadata information, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the Save button. The deposit can be made public by clicking on the Publish button. Please note that publishing the deposit is an irreversible action. Once published, you will be redirected to the deposit's homepage on Zenodo. Key Takeaways and Information for Future Versions We have published the first version of our FAIR-by-Design training. The same steps can be followed for any future version releases. Note that once set, the provided Zenodo secret will not need to be changed or modified in any way from the GitHub web interface. When publishing a newer version of the materials, the workflow will automatically link it to the previous version, so that there is continuity between them, making it easier to view versioning information at a glance from the Zenodo web interface.

Learning Objectives Describe the procedure for publishing learning materials to the learning platform Explain the basic elements of the course in Moodle Configure Moodle course parameters Add different elements to the course Target Audience Attendees of the FAIR-by-Design ToT live webinar Duration 35 mins Prerequisites 16-Publishing Preparations Learning Tools Training BBB room Moodle learning platform Description of the procedure for publishing to the learning platform To make available the learning materials for learners and trainees we will be using the Skills4EOSC learning platform, available at learning.skills4eosc.eu . The learning platform is based on the popular and widely used open source learning management system (LMS) called Moodle . The initial step needed to publish a course at the learning platform is to request one from the platform's administrators. NOTE: Before asking for the course creation, please create an account on the platform, using the \"Log in\" link at the upper right corner of the welcome page. To do so, write an email to learning-support@skills4eosc.eu requesting the creation of the new course and stating the names/emails of the people that will be assigned Trainer (Teacher) role for the course. NOTE: At least one person should be assigned the role Manager, allowing her/him to add more teachers to the course later. Once the course has been created, you can start customizing it and publishing the learning materials. Configuring course parameters The first action usually taken to a new course is to customize its settings. To customize settings, one must have the Teacher (Trainer) role assigned. The main parameters that can be set are: Course full name, Course short name, Course visibility, Course start and end date etc. NOTE: Initially, Course visibility is set to Hide during the preparation of the course. This means that the Learners/Trainees can not see or access the course. Other parameters that could be set for a course include Course summary and image in the Course description section, that are displayed in the course list or dashboard. To customize the way the course material is presented to the trainees, use the settings under the Course format section. The Format parameter lets you choose between several format, including Weekly format (suitable for courses that are offered at the specific time, where material is grouped by weeks) or Topics format (where each section of the course is one topic). For courses that are offered as self-paced learning courses, the Topic format is preferable. Defining tags for the courses helps the users discover the course when searching through the courses offering on the learning platform. RDA metadata fields In the RDA Minimal Metadata Set for Learning Resources you should enter the information for the metadata fields discussed in the Design stage. For these purposes you can simply copy/paste the information from the Syllabus. Creating the course structure When the course has been configured to be in the Topic format, the structure of the course consists of one General topic (created by default when creating the course) and number of Topics. Each topic is a container that will have different learning objects within. To make any changes to the courses, the editing mode has to be turned on, by clicking the switch in the upper right corner. To add a new topic, use the \"Add topic\" link at the bottom left. Each topic will need to have a title as a minimum. One topic can correspond to one or more learning objects. The minimum resources per topic are thus: PDF version of the slide deck (if available) link to the topic content on the generated GitBook assessment quiz for the given topic Adding PDF documents One common type of material that will be added to the courses on the learning platform will be PDF documents, whether they will be pdf versions of the presentations or other materials. As mentioned previously, to make any changes to the course, the editing mode needs to be turned on, by clicking the switch in the upper right corner. The next step is to expand the topic that will contain the pdf file. Once expanded, the topic will contain a link titled \"Add an activity or resource\". By clicking this link, the selection of available activities and resources is displayed. Select the \"File\" resource to proceed to the form for describing and uploading the pdf file. The required attribute of the pfd file is the Name. To upload the file, you can drop the pfd file to the marked space, or use the upload dialog. To finalise the publishing of the pdf file, at the bottom of the page, use one of the Save buttons The \"Save and return to course\" will save the changes and return to the home page of the course, displaying the topics. The \"Save and display\" button will save the changes and display the newly uploaded pdf file. Adding links The procedure for adding links to external resources is similar to the procedure for adding pdf documents. Course needs to be in the editing mode, the required topic should be expanded, and the link \"Add an activity or resource\" should be selected. From the list of activities and resources, select the \"URL\" option. The required attributes are the Name and the External URL. Once the attributes are filled in, the saving options at the bottom of the page are the same as when adding files (\"Save and return to course\" and \"Save and display\"). Working with quizzes Moodle provides rich options for knowledge assessment in the form of Quizzes. Quizzes can contain different types of questions, from simple single or multiple choice, to more advanced types such as matching, drag-and-drop, calculated answers etc. Most of the questions types can be graded automatically, with the exception of the \"Essay\" type, that needs manual grading. The questions used in the quizzes are organized in a question bank, offering a hierarchical structure for questions grouping. The grouping of questions in categories and sub-categories provides better support for automatization of the quiz creating process, offering random choice of questions from the same category, making the assessment more diverse. New questions to the question bank can be added either manually or by import. As the quiz questions have already been developed in the GIFT format, it is recommended that the Import option is used. In addition, it is recommended that each learning unit has its own category in the question bank. Access to the question bank can be done through the link \"More\" and then \"Question bank\" Within the question bank view, activities such as creating and editing categories, adding questions and importing and exporting of questions can be performed. Creating a new category To create a new category for the questions in the question bank, from the \"Categories\" view select the \"Add category\" button. For the newly created category, first select the parent category, and then define the name for it. Adding questions to questions banks manually Individual questions can be added to the question bank manually. To add individual question to the question bank, from the \"Questions\" view of the Question bank, first select the category/sub-category for the questions. Then, select the \"Create a new question\" link. The next form allows for the choice of the question type for the new question. Depending on the type of the question, a form to edit its properties is shown. Once the properties of the question are finalized, the question can be saved to the question bank. If a multiple choice questions is selected, the parameters to be configures are the question name, question text and the answers For the multiple choice questions, one or more answers can be valid. For each of the offered answers, the choice text, grade and feedback can be provided. The choice is the displayed option, while the feedback will be displayed when reviewing a finished quiz. The grade selection defined how much each choice influences the final grade in percentage. The percentage can be also negative for the wrong answers. Importing questions into questions banks To use already prepared questions outside of the learning platform, or questions exported from other courses or learning platforms, the import questions feature can be used. As discussed previously, one of the most popular format for editing questions and their transfer between courses and platforms is the GIFT format. Remember that in the GIFT format, the questions are written as follows Which of the following types of questions is not graded automatically = Essay ~%-10% Multiple choice ~%-10% Numerical ~%-10% Short answer In the example above, the wrong answers have negative score of -10% of the grade for that question. The category of the imported questions can be either specified in the GIFT file using the $CATEGORY: name_of_category modifier, or selected from the General section of the import form. Creating quizzes The creation of quizzes as methods of knowledge assessment can be done in two steps. First, a quiz needs to be added as new activity with type \"Quiz\" to the specific topic of the course. The quiz attributes include name, start and end time for the quiz to be available for the learners, as well as the time limit for each attempt of the quiz. Once the quiz is created, the next step is the selection of the questions. The questions view of the quiz allows configuring the maximum grade of the quiz, whether the questions should be shuffled at each individual attempt, and most importantly to add new questions. When the \"Add\" link is selected, three options are available - \"add new question\", allowing for direct adding new questions to the quiz (and to the question bank) - \"from the questions bank\", allowing a choice of a specific question from the question bank - \"a random question\", giving the opportunity to randomly select a questions for that position in the quiz in each individual attempt. NOTE: the \"a random question\" option can be used to define test strategies. A strategy can be defined by adding random questions from different question categories/sub-categories, allowing for diversity of the individual attempts, from a specified group of questions with similar goal and difficulty. Feedback gathering Gathering feedback from the participants is essential for the whole lifecycle of the learning material, as it represents the main driver for the process of continual improvement. Remember that the gathered feedback should be continuously analyzed and improvement actions should be taken based on this analysis. Additionally, the feedback analysis at the end of the next cycle can be used to measure if the goals set for the new version have been successfully reached. The Skills4EOSC learning platform already provides template for feedback gathering from the learners. To add a feedback form, use the \"Add activity or resource\" link and select the \"Feedback\" item. Provide the name of the item, as well as the period when the feedback gathering will be available, and \"Save and display\" the feedback. Using the \"Templates\" tab of the newly created feedback form, select the template \"Feedback template FAIR-by-Design Learning Materials Methodology\" from the \"Public\" templates section Select the link \"Use this template\" and \"Delete old item\" option when saving. Adding BBB rooms For the courses that will have webinar delivery style, or for the courses that will require recording of the delivery, there is the option to add BigBlueButton (BBB) room. The BBB room can be added just like any other activity or resource, by selecting the BigBlueButton resource type. The main parameters of the BBB room are the room name and the instance type. The instance type can be - Room with recording, where the activity can be used for interactive classes, and the recordings of that classes will be available at the same place - Room only, where the room can be used just for interactive classes and no recording - Recording only, meaning that there will not be an interactive room, just previous recordings. Badges and certificates The certification mechanism is very important stimulation mechanism for the learners. It provides them recognition for the work, provide job market differentiations as well as verification of the gained skills. Skills4EOSC T2.5 recommends the use of Open Digital Badges as means to describe the skills obtained with a training. As an example you can take a look at the set of badges that can be obtained for this particular training, wherein there is a defined badge for each separate stage of the FAIR-by-Design Methodology. Obtaining a per stage badge makes you a FAIR-by-Design Methodology Specialist in the given stage alone. The higher-level all encompassing FAIR instructor badge makes you an instructional designer that knows how to implement all stages of the FAIR-by-Design methodology inside and out. In other words, using digital open badges you can describe the microcredentials that can be obtained by following and being assessed on part of the provided training, or on the training as a whole. Note that T2.5 is currently in the process of developing templates for the digital badges that you can then use a starting point for the visual design of the open badges for your training. In the following text, a brief introduction is provided to how you can create a badge for your training course. To add a badge to the course, use the \"Badges\" link, available through the link \"More\". After clicking the \"Add new badge\", two important steps need to be performed. Firstly, the badge needs to be created with a name, description, uploaded a graphics representation of the badge as well as set the expiry date (if needed). Once this is done, the next step is to define the criteria for earning that specific badge. The awarding criteria can be based on previously earned badges (for an overall course badge to be earned if micro-badges were earned before), full course completion, based on activity completions, gained competences or manually assigned. If the \"Activity completion\" criteria is selected, on the next page all activities of the course are presented and those which completion is recognised by this badge need to be selected. It is recommended that the Activity completion set of criteria is used, as this will enable automatic issuing of the defined one or more digital badges. Furthermore, the Skills4EOSC learning platform is integrated with the Badgr backpack of digital badges, meaning that one can easily add the earned badge into their backpack, as well as share it on social media or other platforms. Making the course visible to learners When the course is ready to be presented to the learners, it needs to be made visible on the learning platform. To make the course visible, in the course setting, the \"Course visibility\" options needs to be set to \"Show\". Indexing the course in the EOSC catalogue The process of building catalogues of EOSC related courses is undergoing significant changes. Thus at the moment we do not provide any detailed instructions on how to ensure that the learning materials are indexed in the EOSC Catalogue. If you would like to receive a more detailed information regarding this option please contact T2.3 members. Activity: Adding content to the course on the learning platform The goal of this activity is to showcase how to add different types of content to the previously created course on the learning platform. For these purposes a Demo course has been created on the learning platform. All participants should have teacher role privileges and can try and test the described steps for adding different types of resources to the learning platform. Key Takeaways and Information for Future Versions By adding all learning units as topic to the learning platform together with the link to the syllabus, the feedback form and the BBB room you have completed the minimum requirements for making the learning content available for learners. More detailed instructions on how to use the learning platform will be provided in a separate Training of Trainers. Until then you can always use the FAIR-by-Design Methodology course on the platform as a blueprint for the organization and availability of the learning materials. Remember that any subsequent changes to the GitBook will automatically reflect on the learning platform via the provided links. However, if you make changes to the assessment questions or slide deck, you will need to manually update the content on the learning platform as well. Finally, keep an eye on the upcoming deliverable from T2.5 that will focus on certification and recognition frameworks and provide more details on Digital Open Badges.

Learning Objectives Perform a QA review of the learning materials Rate FAIRness of learning materials Target Audience attendees of the FAIR-by-Design ToT live webinar Duration 40 mins Prerequisites Completed Stage 5 - Publish Learning Tools Training BBB room Learning platform QA forms T2.4 QA checklists Self-check QA The publication process contains very important steps that aim to create FAIR learning materials accessible to both learners and instructors. Therefore, it is imperative that you first go through a self-check phase to ensure everything is as intended. For these purposes you can use the QA guidelines and checklists developed by T2.4 . Image by Shahid Abdullah from Pixabay T2.4 have developed a number of QA checklists that should be used for this process, two of which are presented in this text. For the full list of checklists and their use please refer to D2.3 . The two QA checklists that are listed here as part of the verification process are: the general QA checklist that focuses on the learning materials content and analyses it from a learners' perspective the FAIR-by-Design QA checklist that focuses on the FAIR aspects of the learning materials and requirements imposed with the use of the methodology General QA The general QA checklist developed by T2.4 addresses the main aspects of the developed learning materials that are related to their quality as perceived by the learners. In the following table these aspects are related to the steps or fields from the FAIR-by-Design methodology to help you understand where, or at which point, this aspect is being addressed by the methodology. Checklist question FAIR-by-Design element Does the learning material title clearly describe what it offers? syllabus (metadata) Does the learning material include its goal? syllabus (metadata) Does the learning material clearly state its target audience? syllabus (metadata) Does the learning material state the level of expertise it is required from its audience? syllabus (metadata) Are the learning objectives/outcomes specific, well-defined, and measurable? syllabus (metadata) Does the learning material clearly describe its program / outline? syllabus (metadata) Does the learning material cover different learning styles? learning content Does the learning material states its delivery method?

The questions marked as essential are related to the FAIR aspects of the obtained learning material. These elements must be present so that the learning materials are achieving bare minimum FAIRness. As you manage to comply with the rest of the items you work on increasing the FAIRness and quality of the learning materials. Essential Topic Stage FAIR aspect Goal CHECKLIST QUESTION Instructional design process Prepare / Learner-centric learning resources Did you follow the stages of the backward instructional design process while developing the learning resource? YES Schema Prepare Interoperable Choose a metadata schema to describe the material, such as the RDA minimal metadata schema Is the RDA minimal (or domain specific) metadata schema used for the learning material description? Vocabularies Prepare Interoperable Define controlled vocabularies for certain fields such as main keywords; learning objectives, audience, microcredentials.. using the controlled vocabularies related to the schema Are controlled vocabularies (CVs) used for describing the resource characteristics aligned with the chosen metadata schema? YES License Design Reusable Reuse of licensed materials with attribution If applicable, is there clear attribution for all reused resources with compatible licenses? YES License Design Reusable permissable license allowing reuse and adaptations Has the learning resource been made available for use by defining a permissable license or policy information that allows derivations? Structure Design Reusable Decide the level of aggregation on which FAIR will be implemented. The more granular the better reuse Does the learning resource represent a complete learning object or aggregation consisting of content, tools and implementation resources defined around minimum one learning objective? Facilitator kit Design Reusable Develop an instructor kit (how to, tips & tricks...) that should help facilitate the proces of others reusing the learning material Does the resource incorporate an instructor kit that aids in facilitating the process of others reusing learning material by offering helpful how-to guides? YES Tools & Formats Produce Interoperable Use interoperable tools that will enable you to save the intermediate (editable) and final content in open file formats Is your resource available in open file formats which are tool agnostic and compatible with a wide variety of existing software? YES Metadata Produce Findable Describe the material (all FAIR objects) using the rules provided in the chosen schema Is metadata for the resource provided in both human- and machine-readable format (e.g JSON, XMLor YAML? YES Accessibility Produce Accessible Ensure accessibility of the material by people with different learning styles and/or with disabilities. Has an accessibility checker tool been utilised to improve the accessibility of all learning resource files (PDF, HTML, video, etc.)? Versioning Publish Reusable Use a versioning system to implement document version control. New versions are released with a new DOI. Have you employed a versioning system to track and control changes in your materials? YES Repositories Publish Findable Publish the new version of the learning materials & metadata Is the complete learning resource (including instructors info) registered or indexed in at least one searchable repository? Is it in a FAIR repository? Access rules Publish Accessible Ensure all material is widely accessible by defining open access rules for learning and reuse Are the resource access rules (how to access, e.g. registration procedure) explicitly communicated to learners? YES Access rules Publish Accessible Ensure all material is widely accessible by defining open access rules for learning and reuse Are access rules (authentication & authorisation) implemented for the learning resource? Catalogue Publish Findable Improve findability by creating an entry in a selected training catalogue(s) (thematic, project, regional, general, etc.) Is the learning resource searchable in at least one relevant catalogue? Is it FAIR (can be searched based on metadata)? Cocreation Verify Accessible Enable the possibility to gather feedback and comments from users and peers Does the course include the possibility to provide feedback or comments from users and-or trainers/designers? If so, do you regurarly gather and analyse that feedback? Cocreation Verify Reusable community building Does the resource adopt an open community approach regarding its quality and reachability? QA Verify / external QA Has the learning resource been checked by a third party regarding its learning experience quality? FAIR FAIR Results Does the resource align with the FAIR-by-design methodology principles? Activity Both the general and the FAIR-by-Design methodology QA checklists are made available as forms on the Skills4EOSC learning platform. Perform a QA self-check using the forms and analyse the obtained score. Based on the results of the self-check QA analysis you should go back and make adjustments and re-publish again if necessary. Don't forget that you should use all QA checklists provided by T2.4 when developing the Skills4EOSC training materials. External QA To truly view the produced learning materials through the lenses of learners and other instructors, you need to perform a QA check with the help of an external party. This external party should be someone who has not been involved in any step of the materials design, better yet has not seen the materials ever before. In this way, you will have a pair of fresh eyes that will review the learning materials without any cognitive bias. Image by OpenClipart-Vectors from Pixabay To further support this effort the chosen QA reviewer should be an expert that is very well versed in the requirements for engaging learning content and learning styles, as well as the FAIR principles. It is their job as an external QA reviewer to evaluate the learning materials performance, quality, and suggest improvements using an objective and independent perspective. The external QA reviewer can use the T2.4 QA guidelines and checklists as a starting point for the QA, but should be encouraged to go more in-depth with the review process. The high impact recommendations in the QA review report should be resolved as soon as possible. The lower level improvement recommendations can be taken into account as relevant input for the continuous improvement step. Learning platform QA In addition to the checklists the external QA reviewer should also ensure that the course on the Skill4EOSC learning platform is working properly. For instructor-led trainings and courses this must be done before the scheduled training takes place. For these purposes the external QA reviewer should assume the role of a learner and try to: access the course information self-enrol in the course go through all of the resources available on the course including quizzes, feedback form and any other type of interaction Any identified problems should be resolved as soon as possible. Feedback-based QA An integral part of the QA process is using the feedback form to evaluate the performance and identify areas of improvement for the developed learning materials. For these purposes the feedback gathered via the implemented feedback form should be regularly analysed and any comments and insights should be taken as input into the continuous improvement phase. For these purposes you can use the Analysis button when clicking on the Feedback form on the Moodle course. Summary Performing a QA self-check after publication is an essential step that aims to ensure that all stages of the FAIR-by-Design methodology have been implemented successfully and the learning materials are accessible and presented as planned. The QA guidelines and checklists developed by T2.4 can be extremely helpful when it comes to QA. By engaging an external QA reviewer you are demonstrating your commitment to producing high-quality learning materials and provide accountability to your learners, the instructors community and the public in general. The suggested improvements by the QA reviewers together with the analysed feedback results are the input that triggers the activation of the continuous improvement step that aims to develop a new higher-quality version of the learning materials.

Your focus should now be turned towards gathering feedback that will help you improve the learning material. Based on the analysed feedback you can decide what incremental changes to implement and create a new improved version of the learning materials. You are now also able to do this improvements in a co-creation process together with the wider community supporting different means of interaction with other potential contributors. Learning Objectives Devise a new version of the learning materials Collaborate with external parties Target Audience attendees of the FAIR-by-Design ToT live webinar Duration 30 mins Prerequisites Completed 19-Final QA check Learning Tools Training BBB room Repo on GitHub Incremental improvements Learning materials are never completely finished. There is always room for improvement and many times need and requirement to keep up to date with the development and changes in the field of subject of the learning materials. Therefore a regular analysis of all QA aspects is necessary to identify potential elements for improvement. Based on the outcomes of the feedback analysis, the authors of the learning materials should make a plan for the development of a new version of the learning materials. Feedback analysis As discussed in the previous learning unit, there are multiple sources that can serve for feedback gathering and QA: feedback form external QA recommendations self-reflection after training GitHub issues gathered comments from external contributors direct mail contact any other means of communication (e.g. feedback from workshops, discussions, team meetings, etc.) The input from all of these sources should be gathered and analysed. The results of the analysis should be a list of potential improvements, each marked with an impact level (high, moderate, low). The next step is to decide which of the improvements will be addressed in the next version and how will this be achieved. Note that depending on the number of identified improvements, you might need to go through the improvement cycle multiple times. It is recommended that the changes are done in an incremental fashion and that changes done in one version are logically related. This help both developers and users to better understand the differences between the versions. New iteration The work on a new iteration starts once the list of identified improvements that will be incorporated into the new version is finalised. The next step is to organise the work regarding the required changes to the learning materials. Depending on the identified improvements, the changes may bring you back to the Produce stage implementing changes in learning units, or even to Design if restructuring of the learning material is needed. When all planned changes are implemented following the requirements and recommendations of the ( Design and) Produce stage(s), you can then move again through the Publish stage and create a new release with a new version number that will then be added as a new version on Zenodo. Note that the provided automated workflow will not create a new independent record on Zenodo, but will add a new version to the already existing Zenodo record . For the specific steps of the publication process please refer back to the respective lesson unit in the Publish stage. The version number is one of the things that you will need to provide when activating a new release. The recommendation based on best practices is to keep the versioning in the Major.Minor.Patch version number sequence. You will increment the minor number if the incremental improvement does not change the overall structure of the learning materials. You will increment the major number if the changes include change in the overall structure of the learning materials. Increment the Patch number in case of only technical fixes. The image below depicts the best practices of semantic versioning. Semantic Versioning by Surjit Bains on Wikimedia Commons licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license. Don't forget to update the resource on the Learning Platform. This is a requirement if the learning material is provided as a self-paced course for an example, but might not be needed if it was a one-time training workshop event after which it is not expected that the learners will keep coming back to the learning content. Note that if you are using the /latest links when adding the resources to the learning platform, you don't need to update any of the external links on the learning platform. However, be careful if the new iteration changes involved changes in the assessment or slide decks. Co-creation with external parties During the publishing process you have also created an open collaborative environment where external parties can directly participate in the process of development and improvement of the learning materials via co-creation. The co-creation support goes beyond providing feedback using the feedback form or suggestions from external QA reviewers. The established open collaboration environment using GitHub can be used by any external party to provide comments using several different means. GitHub Issues When the GitHub repository is made public (as it is required for publication to Zenodo), then the repository is open for anyone to browse and clone. This enables interested external parties to reuse the learning materials, but also analyse them in great detail. Any individual can also use the Issues feature to report problems/suggest changes. All they have to do is go to the repository on GitHub, choose Issues and create a new Issue where they will describe the problem or suggestion. It is good etiquette to first check the list of open issues to see if the problem or suggestion has already been reported by someone else. Note that the external party should follow the rules of the provided Code of Conduct. If not, their messages can be disregarded and deleted. The owners of the repository will get a notification of the created issue and can decide how to respond (accept or decline with explanation). Adding external contributors Frequent reporters of meaningful issues or individuals that may have provided a significant feedback in some other form, may be willing to join the community of collaborators on the learning materials development. To support this type of co-creation in the form of close collaboration, the repository owners can add the external party as a new contributor to the repository with read and write access. This will mean that the external party will join the rest of the authors of the learning materials and become an equal member of the collaboration circle. For more information on collaboration options, revisit the dedicated learning unit part of Stage 4 - Produce . Note that after this you will grant the external party with rights to make changes to any documents in the repository, so they should be familiar with the established way the collaborative team works. Contributing through forking The most \"advanced\" way of co-creation (for GitHub beginners) is to use forking to contribute to a public project. This action can be done by any external party that does not have direct write access to the repository (is not added as a contributor). By using a \"fork and pull workflow\" the external party can Create a fork of the learning materials repository Clone the fork so that the content is available locally Create a branch where all changes will be stored Make and push changes to the branch Make a pull request which will propose the made changes to the main learning materials repository The repository owner can review the pull request and decide to accept or reject it, or maybe ask for more information. Even if the owner decided not to accept the changes in the main repo, the fork will continue to exist separately and be visible to anyone browsing GitHub. Summary Going through the FAIR-by-Design methodology workflow only once is not enough. Learning materials can always be improved and their content should be kept up-to-date. This is where the continuous improvement incremental changes come into play. Analyse the identified improvement points, decide what to implement in a new version and go back through the methodology stages. You are not alone on the continuous improvement journey! Any external party can decide to help you by raising issues, joining your community of contributors or maybe suggesting changes with the fork and pull workflow. End of the road Congratulations! You have arrived at the end of this training. We hope that you have gained a great deal of knowledge and are now ready to put the FAIR-by-Design Methodology into practice. As a final task please take a look at the Postcard from a Friend assignment on the Learning Platform. And, of course, fill out the feedback form and help us improve! Do not forget! You are not alone!

You are now also able to do this improvements in a co-creation process together with the wider community supporting different means of interaction with other potential contributors.","title":"Continuous Improvement"},{"location":"Stage%206%20%E2%80%93%20Verify/20-Continuous%20Improvement/20-CI/#learning-objectives","text":"Devise a new version of the learning materials Collaborate with external parties","title":"Learning Objectives"},{"location":"Stage%206%20%E2%80%93%20Verify/20-Continuous%20Improvement/20-CI/#target-audience","text":"attendees of the FAIR-by-Design ToT live webinar","title":"Target Audience"},{"location":"Stage%206%20%E2%80%93%20Verify/20-Continuous%20Improvement/20-CI/#duration","text":"30 mins","title":"Duration"},{"location":"Stage%206%20%E2%80%93%20Verify/20-Continuous%20Improvement/20-CI/#prerequisites","text":"Completed 19-Final QA check","title":"Prerequisites"},{"location":"Stage%206%20%E2%80%93%20Verify/20-Continuous%20Improvement/20-CI/#learning-tools","text":"Training BBB room Repo on GitHub","title":"Learning Tools"},{"location":"Stage%206%20%E2%80%93%20Verify/20-Continuous%20Improvement/20-CI/#incremental-improvements","text":"Learning materials are never completely finished. There is always room for improvement and many times need and requirement to keep up to date with the development and changes in the field of subject of the learning materials. Therefore a regular analysis of all QA aspects is necessary to identify potential elements for improvement. Based on the outcomes of the feedback analysis, the authors of the learning materials should make a plan for the development of a new version of the learning materials.","title":"Incremental improvements"},{"location":"Stage%206%20%E2%80%93%20Verify/20-Continuous%20Improvement/20-CI/#feedback-analysis","text":"As discussed in the previous learning unit, there are multiple sources that can serve for feedback gathering and QA: feedback form external QA recommendations self-reflection after training GitHub issues gathered comments from external contributors direct mail contact any other means of communication (e.g. feedback from workshops, discussions, team meetings, etc.) The input from all of these sources should be gathered and analysed. The results of the analysis should be a list of potential improvements, each marked with an impact level (high, moderate, low). The next step is to decide which of the improvements will be addressed in the next version and how will this be achieved. Note that depending on the number of identified improvements, you might need to go through the improvement cycle multiple times. It is recommended that the changes are done in an incremental fashion and that changes done in one version are logically related. This help both developers and users to better understand the differences between the versions.","title":"Feedback analysis"},{"location":"Stage%206%20%E2%80%93%20Verify/20-Continuous%20Improvement/20-CI/#new-iteration","text":"The work on a new iteration starts once the list of identified improvements that will be incorporated into the new version is finalised. The next step is to organise the work regarding the required changes to the learning materials. Depending on the identified improvements, the changes may bring you back to the Produce stage implementing changes in learning units, or even to Design if restructuring of the learning material is needed. When all planned changes are implemented following the requirements and recommendations of the ( Design and) Produce stage(s), you can then move again through the Publish stage and create a new release with a new version number that will then be added as a new version on Zenodo. Note that the provided automated workflow will not create a new independent record on Zenodo, but will add a new version to the already existing Zenodo record . For the specific steps of the publication process please refer back to the respective lesson unit in the Publish stage. The version number is one of the things that you will need to provide when activating a new release. The recommendation based on best practices is to keep the versioning in the Major.Minor.Patch version number sequence. You will increment the minor number if the incremental improvement does not change the overall structure of the learning materials. You will increment the major number if the changes include change in the overall structure of the learning materials. Increment the Patch number in case of only technical fixes.

Don't forget to update the resource on the Learning Platform. This is a requirement if the learning material is provided as a self-paced course for an example, but might not be needed if it was a one-time training workshop event after which it is not expected that the learners will keep coming back to the learning content. Note that if you are using the /latest links when adding the resources to the learning platform, you don't need to update any of the external links on the learning platform. However, be careful if the new iteration changes involved changes in the assessment or slide decks.","title":"New iteration"},{"location":"Stage%206%20%E2%80%93%20Verify/20-Continuous%20Improvement/20-CI/#co-creation-with-external-parties","text":"During the publishing process you have also created an open collaborative environment where external parties can directly participate in the process of development and improvement of the learning materials via co-creation. The co-creation support goes beyond providing feedback using the feedback form or suggestions from external QA reviewers. The established open collaboration environment using GitHub can be used by any external party to provide comments using several different means.","title":"Co-creation with external parties"},{"location":"Stage%206%20%E2%80%93%20Verify/20-Continuous%20Improvement/20-CI/#github-issues","text":"When the GitHub repository is made public (as it is required for publication to Zenodo), then the repository is open for anyone to browse and clone. This enables interested external parties to reuse the learning materials, but also analyse them in great detail. Any individual can also use the Issues feature to report problems/suggest changes. All they have to do is go to the repository on GitHub, choose Issues and create a new Issue where they will describe the problem or suggestion. It is good etiquette to first check the list of open issues to see if the problem or suggestion has already been reported by someone else. Note that the external party should follow the rules of the provided Code of Conduct. If not, their messages can be disregarded and deleted. The owners of the repository will get a notification of the created issue and can decide how to respond (accept or decline with explanation).","title":"GitHub Issues"},{"location":"Stage%206%20%E2%80%93%20Verify/20-Continuous%20Improvement/20-CI/#adding-external-contributors","text":"Frequent reporters of meaningful issues or individuals that may have provided a significant feedback in some other form, may be willing to join the community of collaborators on the learning materials development. To support this type of co-creation in the form of close collaboration, the repository owners can add the external party as a new contributor to the repository with read and write access. This will mean that the external party will join the rest of the authors of the learning materials and become an equal member of the collaboration circle. For more information on collaboration options, revisit the dedicated learning unit part of Stage 4 - Produce . Note that after this you will grant the external party with rights to make changes to any documents in the repository, so they should be familiar with the established way the collaborative team works.","title":"Adding external contributors"},{"location":"Stage%206%20%E2%80%93%20Verify/20-Continuous%20Improvement/20-CI/#contributing-through-forking","text":"The most \"advanced\" way of co-creation (for GitHub beginners) is to use forking to contribute to a public project. This action can be done by any external party that does not have direct write access to the repository (is not added as a contributor).

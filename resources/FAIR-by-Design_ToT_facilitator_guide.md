# FAIR-by-Design Training Facilitator Guide

The purpose of this document is to include all necessary information regarding the preparation and planning of the FAIR-by-Design Training of Trainers.
The training is organized as an online multi-day webinar using a Big Blue Button (BBB) room integrated into a Moodle based learning platform for course materials and interaction with trainees. 

## Training materials, resources and equipment
### Learning materials
The learning materials for the trainees should all be available on the learning platform before the beginning of the event, divided per learning sections (topics). 
At the top of the course before the learning sections add:
- link to BBB room
- open forum
- feedback form
- training syllabus

Each learning section should have:
- Slides in PDF
- Learning Notes (HTML of learning unit contents)
- Activity links or documents (if any)
- Further reading links
- Self-assessment quiz

The trainers materials latest version is taken from the GitHub repo.

### Resources
- Menti prepared according to the activities
    - if Menti is not available, use internal BBB quiz by copy-pasting the questions
- BBB room added to the course on the learning platform
- MD editor of choice (VS code)

## Before the training
- [ ] Send out save-the-date email
- [ ] Setup course on learning platform, enable self-enrollment for trainees, give all trainers appropriate rights
- [ ] Send out call for training including the syllabus and link to the course
- [ ] Prepare for activities (write questions in Menti and test) 
- [ ] Schedule testing in the BBB room for trainers (3-4 days before training)
- [ ] Schedule testing access to BBB room and learning materials for trainees (usually 30 mins before start of training)
- [ ] Assign moderator that will follow the chat and help with technical issues, Menti, etc.

## During the training
- [ ] Use 00 to welcome participants, introduce people and define expectations and rules
- [ ] Ask people to jump in during the training at any time using chat or mic (moderator will follow and prompt the trainer if needed)
- [ ] The first ice breaking activity should also be used as a way to test if the interactive tool is working (BBB quiz and/or Menti)
- [ ] The main welcome activity is to be considered as input as to where to draw the attention when training and doing activities
- [ ] Create a discussion environment by having multiple trainers talking together about tips and tricks and encouraging others to join
- [ ] Use anonymous online tools for the practical activities to overcome shyness or fear of failure
- [ ] Encourage co-creation, ask others to recommend an action or tool or resource that may be used to accomplish a goal


## After the training
- [ ] Send out a reminder for feedback gathering and badge collecting
- [ ] Write down reflection comments for each training unit
- [ ] Analyze gathered feedback
- [ ] Initiate work on a new version of the training materials

# Writing Attribution

The activity provides an opportunity to practice writing attribution and citing for different media. 

## Activity duration

10 mins

## Number of people that it can be performed with

any

## Goal of activity

- Identify the license of a resource.
- Determine if it can be reused or only cited
- Write the attribution
- Write citation

## Materials

- list of example URLs of learning materials that need to be attributed 
- notepad for writing down the attribution

## Instructions

1. Trainees are provided with a URL link to an example learning material and are asked to write down the appropriate attribution. 

After collecting the responses, the trainer can start a group discussion on many of the TASL elements have been present in the examples.

The information provided to the trainees is:

Write attribution for the following learning resources that you have decided to incorporate in your learning materials:

- image from https://creativecommons.org/2021/12/02/unesco-recommendation-on-open-science-ratified/
- TRIPLE TRAINING on Open Research Europe slides from https://project.gotriple.eu/triple-open-science-training-series/
- [slide 3 from Why open science? presentation by Sarah Jones](https://slideplayer.com/slide/12073970/)
- Lesson 1: The What from https://github.com/opensciency/sprint-content/blob/main/ethos-of-open/lesson1-intro-to-open-science.md

2. In the second stage of the exercise, the trainees need to check if attribution and citing are correct for a given resource.

Trainer provides a URL to example resource

- [source example learning material that can be adapted](./attribution_example.md)

3. In the final stage trainer starts a group discussion on possible attribution problems by providing ambiguous examples

Take a look at these two examples:

- image from [https://www.openscience-twente.com/open-science/#open-scientific-knowledge](https://www.openscience-twente.com/open-science/#open-scientific-knowledge)
- image from [https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000383323](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000383323)

The problem here is that the original image source is the second link but there is no attribution available in the first link. Yet when searching open science in Google with Creative Commons licenses filter, the first link is also the first to appear.

## Tips and Tricks

- if done physically, provide sheets and pens for taking notes and project the content of each URL on a canvas so that everyone can see it

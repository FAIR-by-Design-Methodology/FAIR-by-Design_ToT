# Checking CC licenses

The activity provides an opportunity to understand the concepts of combining, adapting and remixing CC licensed resources as well as defining the final license. 

## Activity duration

10 mins

## Number of people that it can be performed with

any

## Goal of activity

- Identify the license of a resource.
- Determine if resources can be combined
- Determine if adaptation can be created by combining materials
- Determine the adapter license

## Materials
- list of example URLs of learning materials that need to be combined
- multi-check response sheet or Menti slides setup as:
    1. Reuse of resource is allowed?
        - Yes / No
    2. Content can be combined?
        - Yes / No
    3. Can you make the intended remixes?
        - Yes / No
    4. What will be the final license of your work?
        - CC 0
        - CC BY
        - CC BY-NC
        - CC BY-NC-ND
        - CC BY-NC-SA
        - CC BY-ND
        - CC BY-SA


## Instructions

Trainees are provided with a URL link to an example learning material and are asked to fill out the multi-check response having in mind the CC licensing rules that are introduced earlier. 

After collecting the responses, the trainer can start a group discussion on approaches to license identification.

The information provided to the trainees is:

You are preparing a new course on Open Science and have decided to combine some already available content (images or even whole learning units) and also create your own learning content (additional learning units). 

The content that you would like to reuse is:

- Your adaptation of [Lesson 1 - What is Open Data from OpenSciency](https://github.com/opensciency/sprint-content/blob/main/open-data/Lesson1-WhatIsOpenData.md)
- [M1 - Open Science Ambassador Training from EURODOC](https://eurodoc.net/open-science-ambassadors-training/m1-open-science) 
- [slide 3 from Why open science? presentation by Sarah Jones](https://slideplayer.com/slide/12073970/)
- [slide 10 from Why open science? presentation by Sarah Jones](https://slideplayer.com/slide/12073970/)
- [slide 5 from Why open science? presentation by Sarah Jones](https://slideplayer.com/slide/12073970/) combined with [the badges image and text from Center for Open Science](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/badges) into a new adaptation

1. The first thing you need to check is if reuse is allowed, i.e. check the licenses under which the content is released.

2. If this is so, then you need to determine if it is allowed to combine together these contents.

3. For the content that will be adapted, you need to check how the remix may be used.

3. Finally, you need to decide on the license of your work.

Answers:

1. Licenses are 
    - CC BY
    - CC BY
    - CC BY-NC-SA
    - CC BY-SA
    - CC BY + CC BY-NC-SA
so the answer is yes, as all are CC licenses allowing for reuse under given conditions.

2. Yes the content can be combined as is

3. The first remix can be done as long as your own content is not licensed using ND. The last adaptation can also be done, so the final answer is yes

4. the license of the last adaptation must be CC BY-NC-SA
the license of the first two can be CC BY. If one license needs to be provided for the whole resource then it must be CC BY-NC-SA.

## Tips and Tricks
- if done physically, provide sheets and pens for taking notes and project the content of each URL on a canvas so that everyone can see it

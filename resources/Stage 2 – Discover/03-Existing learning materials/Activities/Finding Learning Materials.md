# Finding Learning Materials

The activity promotes understanding among the participants about what to expect when using different repositories and catalogues to search for existing learning materials that can be used. 

## Activity duration

30 mins

## Number of people that it can be performed with

any

## Goal of activity

The activity aims to empower participants by enabling them to cross compare the searching and filtering abilities of different examples and learn tips and tricks on how to find what you are looking for. 
The activity also showcases the problems of finding relevant materials that can be truly reused.

## Materials

- list of URLs of potential repos and catalogues to explore

## Instructions

### Scenario setup:

You have been tasked to develop a new course on the topic of Open Science for policy makers. You already went through step 1 of the backward instructional process and defined the essential information including learning objectives. 

> Spend some time thinking how can you assess if someone has managed to reach the defined learning objectives? This should help you identify the main concepts that you need to cover in your courses and develop content and activities around. 

> Now it is time to start searching through repositories and catalogues and find materials you could possibly reuse or be inspired with.

### Tasks assigned to participants

1. Start from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) with the "open science training" keywords
    - notice the **type Lesson** available in the filter on the left
    - the file type filter further allows you to choose different file formats
        - bear in mind that the **zip file type** is typically associated with content developed on GitHub and this usually means editable content in an open format (usually md); for details on this refer to the [Produce](../../../Stage%204%20â€“%20Produce/08-Development%20Tools/08-Introduction%20to%20Markdown%20and%20Git.md) section.
        - this is where you will find the currently very popular [Opensciency learning materials](https://zenodo.org/record/7662732).  
    - using the keyword "course" usually provides you with mostly lesson type resources, but sometimes the type other is also used for learning resources 
        - an example is [Re:ERUA Open Science Fundamental Course](https://zenodo.org/record/7701846)

2. Now try [OSF search](https://osf.io/search/)
    - the filter here is not as sophisticated as in Zenodo, so you will need to play with adding keywords such as "training" or "course"
    - look around and try to find something useful.
        - notice what information you would like to see to help you with your search
        - notice that some resources are available only to registered users
    - this is where you will find the [Open Science Course](https://osf.io/x6892/) example
        - take a look at the structure and the documents

3. Lets try the OER repos/catalogues next
    - try searching for "open science" in [OASIS](https://oasis.geneseo.edu/), [OER commons](https://oercommons.org/) and [MERLOT](https://www.merlot.org/merlot/index.htm)
    - notice that many results overlap across the different repos
    - can you find something more specific such as a lesson plan, syllabus, or assignment?
    - are you able to find a multimedia oriented materials such as a video, podcast, or similar?
        - in OASIS you should be able to find a TED talk video on [Open Science Now!](https://www.ted.com/talks/michael_nielsen_open_science_now)
        - in OER Commons you should be able to find the [Open Goverment at NASA](https://oercommons.org/courses/open-government-at-nasa)
        - in MERLOT you should be able to find online course [Open Science: Sharing Your Research with the World](https://www.merlot.org/merlot/viewMaterial.htm?id=1377011)
            - are you able to access the materials which are licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0?

4. The next stop is [FORTT](https://forrt.org/) and its [Educational Nexus](https://forrt.org/nexus/)
    - try to find an Open Science lesson plan here
    - you should be able to get to the [Lesson plan 4: Intro to Open Science lesson plan](https://osf.io/x3m9k) hosted on OSF
    - note that there are links to other learning resources in the lesson plan

5. The final stop is the [EOSC training catalogue](https://search.marketplace.eosc-portal.eu/search/training?q=*)
    - notice that there are resource types such as lesson plan, activity plan and assessment
    - also note that the same resource can have multiple types
    - you should be able to find the "Toolkit for policy makers on Open Access and Open Science"(https://www.openaire.eu/toolkit-for-policy-makers-on-open-science-and-open-access)

### Trainer guidance

The participants should be provided with the links one by one going through each step of the activity. As they are exploring the trainer should help them by providing the tips and tricks in the sub-bullets and by promoting thinking-out-loud where anyone can share their findings with the rest of the group.

## Tips and Tricks

- if done physically, provide sheets and pens for taking notes and project the content of each URL on a canvas so that everyone can see it

## Related sources

- other repos and catalogues can be used, for example the ones developed by different EOSC projects

## Comments

- how did it go
- supporting the co-creation process

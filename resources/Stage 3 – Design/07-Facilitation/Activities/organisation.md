# Logical organization of learning materials

The activity aims at visualizing the logical organization of learning materials development and its implications. 

## Activity duration

7 mins

## Number of people that it can be performed with

any

## Goal of activity

Analyze an example learning materials repo on GitHub, understand the logical organization and rules that need to be followed so that the process of publishing can be automated.

## Materials

- [example repo](https://github.com/FAIR-by-Design-Methodology/FAIR-by-Design_ToT)
- [final HTML](https://fair-by-design-methodology.github.io/FAIR-by-Design_ToT/latest/)

## Instructions

Trainees are asked to analyze the provided Example Learning Materials GitHub Reoo so that they can understand the logical organization in folders that needs to be followed.

Ensure that they understand the optional depth of learning content folders and quiz strategy placement.
However, they must understand that the rest of the structure is fixed (including naming of folders and files) as this will reflect on the automated workflow for publishing. 

Discuss, why two separate sets of metadata in syllabus? Human and machine friendly version...
Is there a more elegant way to accomplish the desired effect?

Compare the folder tree layout with the final HTML layout and discuss differences.

## Tips and Tricks

- Note that the structure is very similar to other similar repositories, such as the one of NASA Open Science.
- if done physically, project the example and give a virtual tour soliciting comments

## Related materials

- you can do this with any learning materials stores
    - other GitHub, OSF, etc.

## Comments

- how did it go
- supporting the co-creation process

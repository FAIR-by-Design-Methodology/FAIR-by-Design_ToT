# Define a learning unit plan

The activity aims at getting a hands on experience on creating a learning unit plan.

## Activity duration

10 mins

## Number of people that it can be performed with

any

## Goal of activity

Create an example learning unit plan, understand the essential information that is required as part of the plan.

## Materials
- [plan example](../attachments/02-Preparing%20FAIR%20Learning%20Objects_plan.html)
- text (md) editor

## Instructions

Trainees are asked to analyse the provided Unit Plan Example so that they can understand the information that needs to be provided for all required plan elements.
Then they should try to define the learning plan for an example course on Open Science for policy makers for which they already have defined the learning structure with identified learning units. 

How difficult it was to complete this task?
You might need to refine the detailed plan schedule in several iterations as the learning content is being developed.

## Tips and Tricks
- if done physically, provide the example as a handout

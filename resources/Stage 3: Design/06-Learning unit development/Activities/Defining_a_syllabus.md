# Assessing FAIRness of Learning Materials

The activity enables getting a first feel of the broad understanding of the FAIR principles when applied to learning materials. Opposite opinions give room for a group discussion and clarification of terms as well as identification of missing subject matter knowledge. 

## Activity duration

15 mins

## Number of people that it can be performed with

any

## Goal of activity

Do a preliminary assessment of the FAIRness of different types of training materials chosen in such a way that they showcase different examples and levels of FAIR implementation.

## Materials
- list of example URLs of learning materials that need to be assessed
- multi-check response sheet or Menti slide setup as:
    - From learners perspective
        - [ ] F
        - [ ] A
        - [ ] I
        - [ ] R
    - From trainers perspective
        - [ ] F
        - [ ] A
        - [ ] I
        - [ ] R


## Instructions

Trainees are provided with a URL link to an example learning material and are asked to fill out the multi-check response having in mind the FAIR Learning Objects characteristics that are introduced earlier. 

After collecting the responses, the trainer can ask additional questions that should prompt discussion on why/how decisions were made:
- What information is missing to make the material FAIR?
- On what granularity level have you assessed the FAIRness?
- What type of detailed information is needed so that you can perform a real FAIR assessment?

While the group discussion is ongoing take into account that at this moment in the training there are still no strict definitions on many elements such as metadata schema and license types. This means that the FAIRness is going to be assessed based on the general understanding of the concepts of FAIR and learning objects that will vary from person and person. Thus, all opinions are valid as long as they relate to the listed FAIR learning objects objective.

Once the discussion is completed, move to the next URL.
Ensure at least 5 mins per URL.

URLs to examples that can be used:

## Tips and Tricks
- it will take less time for assessment for each next example provided as people learn what to look for 
- if done physically, provide sheets and pens for taking notes and project the content of each URL on a canvas so that everyone can see it
- you can revert back to this exercise later on and do it again and compare the differences once all terms and expectations have been clarified

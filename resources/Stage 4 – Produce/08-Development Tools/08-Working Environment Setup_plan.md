# Working Environment Setup

## Goal

The purpose of this learning unit is to introduce relevant tools and file formats required for developing FAIR-by-Design learning objects. Once a working environment consisting of the recommended tools is in place and the initial concepts regarding the underlying file formats have been adopted, the instructional designer is then ready to start with production of the learning objects themselves.

### Location

- Online
- BBB course room

### Total duration

120 mins

### Number of attendees

- any (< 100)

### Learning objectives

- Recognize and use open file formats for producing FAIR learning objects
- Use a version management system for versioning file contents
- Select freely accessible software tools for working with the file formats
- Operate an already created automated publishing workflow for processing any changes made to the learning materials
- Explain the process of making changes to the learning objects and publishing them as a Git book

# First Steps with Git

This activity promotes understanding among the participants about how to use Git as a version management system while developing learning materials, covering initial steps that need to be undertaken.

## Activity duration

10 minutes

## Number of People that it can be Performed With

Any

## Goal of Activity

The goal of this activity is to have the participants create an account on GitHub, create their first repository and download it locally for further changes.
The activity also showcases the required steps for working with Git repositories locally.

## Materials

- URL to the FAIR-by-Design template repository, https://github.com/FAIR-by-Design-Methodology/templates.
- A GitHub account per participant.
- Necessary software tools already installed on the participants' workstations:
    - [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

## Instructions

### Scenario Setup

As a first step on the journey for producing FAIR-by-Design learning objects, you need to configure the working environment, setting up the necessary tools and registering accounts on the online platforms which are to be used throughput the production process.

### Tasks Assigned to Participants

1. Start by setting up your GitHub environment.
    - Login to your existing GitHub account.
    - Navigate to your profile and create a new organization.
    - Optionally invite any additional collaborators that need to have access to the organization.
2. Fork the FAIR-by-Design templates repository.
    - Navigate to [FAIR-by-Design-Methodology/templates](https://github.com/FAIR-by-Design-Methodology/templates)
    - Fork the repository using the `Fork` button in the right corner.
    - Follow the forking wizard until you are presented with the landing page of the new repository.
3. Using the [GitHub Desktop Client](https://desktop.github.com/) make a local copy of the forked repository.
    - Open the GitHub Desktop client and login using your GitHub credentials.
    - Clone the forked repository locally.

### Trainer Guidance

The participants should already have a GitHub account created and downloaded the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) client on their local machines before the start of the exercise. As they are performing the exercise, the trainer should provide additional instructions and help as needed, as well as promoting thinking-out-loud where anyone can share their findings with the rest of the group.

## Tips and Tricks

- If done physically, make sure that the URL to the template repository is projected at all times and is easily readable from the participants' seats.

## Related Sources

- For this activity it is not required to fork the `templates` repository, instead participants can fork an arbitrary repository or simply create a brand new one. However, it is recommended to stick to the instructions, since later activities assume the local availability of the `templates` repository.

# Setting up a Markdown Editor

This activity examines the use of Obsidian as a locally installed Markdown editing software, promoting an easy way of working with Markdown files both for new and experienced users.

## Activity duration

7 minutes

## Number of People that it can be Performed With

Any

## Goal of Activity

The goal of this activity is for participants to get acquainted to Obsidian as Markdown editor which can later be used for working with the intermediate Markdown format during the production phase of the learning materials.

The activity will also focus on extending the out-of-the-box experience of Obsidian, by making it more user-friendly through the installation of a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) editing toolbar.

## Materials

- Local clone of the previously forked `templates` repository.
- Necessary software tools already installed on the participants' workstations:
    - [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

## Instructions

### Scenario Setup

Having made a local clone of the forked `templates` repository, you are interested in exploring ways in which Markdown files can be edited.

### Tasks Assigned to Participants

1. Start by loading the cloned repository into Obsidian.
    - Open Obsidian.
    - Select the option to open an existing folder as a vault.
2. Get acquainted with the directory tree pane and the preview pane in Obsidian.
    - Explore the contents of the cloned repository using the tree view pane shown on the left side.
    - Click on an arbitrary Markdown file and explore its content in the preview pane on the right.
3. Extend Obsidian by installing a WYSIWYG editing toolbar.
    - Using the cog icon in the bottom left corner open the Obsidian settings.
    - Enable the support for community plugins.
    - Search and install the plugin named `Editing Toolbar`.
4. Verify that the toolbar has been successfully installed by previewing some of the existing documents.
5. Configure attachment handling in Obsidian.
    - Go back to the settings page by clicking on the cog icon.
    - Navigate to the `Files & Links` section and instruct Obsidian to place attachments in a subfolder under the current working folder.
6. Verify the attachment handling functionality
    - Copy an existing picture from your workstation.
    - Open an arbitrary existing Markdown document in Obsidian or create a new one.
    - Paste the picture directly and verify that it both appears in the preview pane and that a new `attachments` subfolder is visible in the directory tree pane.

### Trainer Guidance

The participants should already have Obsidian installed on their local machines before the start of the exercise. As they are performing the exercise, the trainer should provide additional instructions and help as needed, as well as promoting thinking-out-loud where anyone can share their findings with the rest of the group.

## Tips and Tricks

- Make sure that the settings that configuration settings that need to be changed are prominently displayed on a slide throughout the exercise.

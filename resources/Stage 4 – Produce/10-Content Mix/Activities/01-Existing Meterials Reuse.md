any

## Goal of Activity

Create a new learning unit by following the provided FAIR-by-Design Markdown templates.

## Materials

- GitHub Desktop
- Web browser

## Instructions

Trainees are asked to create a complete learning unit, where the main content is reused from a third-party source. Step by step instructions are given for the whole process, and the recommended material for re-use is licensed under a compatible, CC-BY license. The creation of a lesson plan is skipped, since it has been completed as part of the previous exercise.

## Tips and Tricks

- Provide the link to the Markdown file to be reused in the presentation.
- In case some of the trainees encounter problems navigating the directory tree where their forked repository has been cloned, provide individual help and troubleshoot issues as they arise.

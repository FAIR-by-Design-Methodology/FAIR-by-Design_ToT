# Observing Changes

The purpose of this activity is for the trainees to verify the changes that they have made to their training unit, once it has been converted to a Git book representation.

## Activity duration

15 mins

## Number of people that it can be performed with

any

## Goal of Activity

View and verify the Git book content.

## Materials

- Obsidian
- GitHub Desktop
- Web browser

## Instructions

Trainees are asked to push the changes made as part of the learning unit development to GitHub. Once pushed, the automated publishing workflow will be run. After the workflow has completed, the changes should be visible to each trainee on their own Git book website.

## Tips and Tricks

- Point out that once pushed, the changes are not immediately reflected on the website. A couple of minutes (usually in the range of 1-2) need to pass for the whole workflow to complete.

## Comments

Showcase how to use and what to expect from tools for accessibility evaluation that automate the WCAG success criteria. 

## Activity duration

10 mins

## Number of people that it can be performed with

any

## Goal of activity

Analyze the accessibility of an example learning web content, understand the limitations of the tools and their differences, as well as the meaning of WCAG compliance.

## Materials

- Chrome + LERA extension
- [example HTML 1](https://fair-by-design-methodology.github.io/FAIR-by-Design_ToT/latest/)
- [example HTML 2](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/)
- [Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools List](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/?q=wcag-21-w3c-web-content-accessibility-guidelines-21)

## Instructions

Trainees are asked to analyze the accessibility of the provided Example Learning Materials HTML 1 and HTML 2 using LERA and another tool of their own choice from the W3C Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools List.

Ensure that they understand that different tools might generate different lists of issues and that some success criteria must be manually checked. 

Discuss, are the tools listed as free software completely free for use? Do they have any limitations?
Is there a more elegant way to accomplish the desired effect?


## Tips and Tricks

- many of the listed tools offer limited amounts of tests per day
- many of the tools do not work properly and show errors when trying to use them
- compare the results with the results obtained when using Chrome Lighthouse which is not WCAG compliant

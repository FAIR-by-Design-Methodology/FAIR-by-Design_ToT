# Adding machine-readable metadata and LICENSE file

Practice on how to fill out the YAML based metadata in syllabus and change the license file in the repo. 

## Activity duration

10 mins

## Number of people that it can be performed with

any

## Goal of activity

Understand the YAML syntax of the MD metadata. Validate that the GitHub repo presents the correct license.

## Materials

- Obsidian
- [syllabus template](https://github.com/FAIR-by-Design-Methodology/templates/blob/main/resources/syllabus.md)
- GitHub

## Instructions

Trainees are asked to try and fill out some of the metadata fields in the syllabus template file based on the already defined content of the syllabus main body. 

Point out some specifics of the YAML syntax:

- using spaces not tabs
- using quotation marks
- using tags instead of keywords
- using # to mark comments

Discuss the necessity of doubling the information in the syllabus file.

Once the syllabus is completed, the license of the REPO needs to be changed with:

1. Find and download the correct plaintext version of your license
    - [Plaintext versions of Creative Commons 4.0 licenses](https://creativecommons.org/2014/01/07/plaintext-versions-of-creative-commons-4-0-licenses/)
2. Open the downloaded legalcode.txt file
3. Select All and Copy its content
4. Open the LICENSE file in your repo
5. Select All and Paste the content of the legalcode.txt overwriting the old content
6. Save the new content of the LICENSE file
7. Commit and Push the changes
7. Go to your repo on GitHub
8. Check the license information on the right-hand side in About

Is the new license information correct? How is it presented?
Check with other repos, e.g. opensciency.

## Tips and Tricks

- YAML is quite sensitive when it comes to the use of spaces

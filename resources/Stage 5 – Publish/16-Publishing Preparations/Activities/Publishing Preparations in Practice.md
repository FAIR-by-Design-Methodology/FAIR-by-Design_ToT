# Observing Changes

The purpose of this activity is for the trainees to update the accompanying files `CITATION.cff`, `README.md`, and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` with relevant information related to their training.

## Activity duration

5 mins

## Number of people that it can be performed with

any

## Goal of Activity

Make necessary changes to the `CITATION.cff`, `README.md`, and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` files.

## Materials

- Obsidian
- GitHub Desktop
- Web Browser
- Text Editor

## Instructions

The trainees are asked to update the controlled vocabulary fields of the `CITATION.cff` file, as well as the free text files `README.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`. Trainees should be warned that they should focus only on the fields outlined in the description of the activity (`authors`, `title`, `abstract`, `license`, `license-url`, `keywords`, `repository`) when editing the `CITATION.cff` file, since all of the others will be filled out by the automated workflow which will be executed when depositing the contents of the repository to Zenodo.

## Tips and Tricks

- It is recommended to keep the slide listing the fields to be edited in the `CITATION.cff` file visible at all times. If done in-person, the instructor can monitor the progress of the participants, pointing out any errors in the YAML syntax or incorrect values in controlled vocabulary fields.

## Comments

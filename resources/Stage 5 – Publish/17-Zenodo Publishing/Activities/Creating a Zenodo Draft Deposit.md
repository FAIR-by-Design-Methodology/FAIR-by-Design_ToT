# Observing Changes

The purpose of this activity is for the trainees to deposit the first version of their training materials on Zenodo.

## Activity duration

30 mins

## Number of people that it can be performed with

any

## Goal of Activity

Make necessary changes to the `CITATION.cff`, `README.md`, and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` files.

## Materials

- Obsidian
- GitHub Desktop
- Web Browser

## Instructions

The trainees are asked to register for an API token using an existing or newly created Zenodo account. They are then instructed to create a new GitHub secret with the value of the generated token, authorizing the automated workflows to connect and create draft deposits on Zenodo on their behalf. From that point forward, the automated workflow will update the necessary metadata information in various files in the repository and publish a draft deposit on Zenodo.

Trainees should be advised that the publishing workflow might take around 3-5 minutes to complete in full. Additionally, it should be reiterated that the automated workflow will not make the deposit publicly available and instead it will only create a draft version. Trainees will have an additional opportunity to validate the correctness of this draft version before opting to make it publicly available.

## Tips and Tricks

- It is not required for the trainees to end the exercise by making the deposit publicly available. It is sufficient to simply check the draft's correctness and then delete it.

## Description of the procedure for publishing to the learning platform

In this course we will be using the Skills4EOSC learning platform, available at [learning.skills4eosc.eu](https://learning.skills4eosc.eu). The learning platform is based on the popular and widely used open source learning managemet system (LMS) called [Moodle](https://moodle.org).
The initial step needed to publish a course at the learning platform is to request one from the platform's adminstrators. 
> NOTE: Before asking for the course creation, please create an account on the platform, using the "Log in" link at the upper right corner of the welcome page. 

To do so, write an email to [learning-support@skills4eosc.eu](mailto:learning-support@skills4eosc.eu) requesting the creation of the new course, as well as stating the names/emails of the people that will be assigned Trainer (Teacher) role of the course.
>NOTE: At least one person should be assigned the role Trainer (Teacher), allowing her/him to add more teachers to the course later. 

Once the course has been created, you can start customizing it and publishing the learning materials. 

### Configuring course parameters
The first action usually taken to a new course is to customise its settings. To customise settigns, one must have the Teacher (Trainer) role assigned. 
![Course settings](./attachments/01-CourseSettings.png)
The main parameters that can be set are: Course full name, Course short name, Course visiblity, Course start and end date etc. 
>NOTE: Initially, Course visibility is set to Hide during the preparation of the course. This means that the Learnerns/Trainees can not see or access the course. 

Other parameters that could be set for a course include Course summary and image in the Course decsription section, that are displayed in the coruse list or dahboard.
To customise the way the course material is presented to the trainees, use the settings unde the Course format section. The Format parameter lets you choose between several format, including Weekliy format (sutaible for courses that are offered at the specific time, where material is grouped by weeks) or Topics format (where eachs section of the course is one topic). For courses that are offered as self learing courses, the Topic format is preferable.

Defining tags for the courses helps the users discover the course when searching through the courses offering on the learning platform. 

### Creating course structure
When the course has been configured to be in the Topic format, the structure of the course consists of one General topic (created by default when creating the course) and number of Topics. Each topic is a contanier that will have different learning objects within.

To make any changes to the courses, the editing mode has to be turned on, by clicking the switch in the upper right corner.

# Quality Assurance and FAIR verification

When publishing is completed, the learning materials are made available for both the learners and instructors communities. The publishing process consists of many steps taking place on several different platforms and is therefore prone to errors. It is thus prudent to verify that all is as it should be afterwards including the FAIR aspects of the learning materials. In addition, this is the moment when external quality assurance (QA) should be engaged to assess the produced learning materials from both learners and instructors perspective. 

For these purposes you can use the QA guidelines and checklists developed by Skills4EOSC T2.4.

## Self-check QA

The publication process contains very important step that aim to create FAIR learning materials that is accessible to both learners and instructors. Therefore, it is imperative that you first go through a self-check phase to ensure everything is as intended. For these purposes you can use the QA guidelines and checklists developed by T2.4.

Two QA checklists are important to be used for the process of verification:

- the general QA checklist that focuses on the learning materials content and analyses it from a learners' perspective
- the FAIR-by-Design QA checklist that focuses on the FAIR aspects of the learning materials and requirements imposed with the use of the methodology

### General QA

The general QA checklist developed by T2.4 addresses the main aspects of the developed learning materials that are related to their quality as perceived by the learners. In the following table these aspects are related to the steps or fields from the FAIR-by-Design methodology to help you understand where, or at which point, this aspect is being addressed by the methodology.

| **Checklist question** | **FAIR-by-Design element** |
|---|---|
| Does the learning material title clearly describe what it offers? | syllabus (metadata) |
| Does the learning material include its goal? | syllabus (metadata) |
| Does the learning material clearly state its target audience? | syllabus (metadata) |
| Does the learning material state the level of expertise it is required from its audience? | syllabus (metadata) |
| Are the learning objectives/outcomes specific, well-defined, and measurable? | syllabus (metadata) |
| Does the learning material clearly describe its program / outline? | syllabus (metadata) |

| Does the learning material states its delivery method? (live sessions, self-learning, hybrid, face-to-face...) | syllabus (metadata) |
| Does the learning material state the date when it was published and/or the date of the newest version? | syllabus (metadata) |
| If needed, does the learning material state the dates the training takes place?  | syllabus |
| Does the learning material states the expected duration of the training? | syllabus |
| Does the learning material specify the developer/author of the learning material? |  |
| Does the learning material specify the trainer/s of the learning material? | syllabus |

| Does the learning material include any assignment? Are assessment strategies consistent with learning material objectives and are clearly stated? | activities |
| Is grading policy provided in a manner that clearly defines expectations for the learning material and respective assignments? | quiz strategy |
| Is the learning material comprised of micro-credentials that can be aligned to create a larger milestone credential? | certification information in syllabus and learning units |
| Does the learning material end with an activity that allows for feedback? | feedback form |
| Does the learning material include relevant keywords related to the content and structure? | syllabus (metadata) |
| Does the learning material include information regarding whether the access to it implies costs? | syllabus (metadata) |
| Does the learning material state the language used? | syllabus (metadata) |

### FAIR-by-Design Methodology QA checklist

With the FAIR-by-Design methodology QA checklist you can check if you have followed the most important aspects of the methodology and managed to produce FAIR learning materials. The questions marked as essential are related to the FAIR aspects of the obtained learning material. These elements must be present so that the learning materials are achieving bare minimum FAIRness. As you manage to comply with the rest of the items you work on increasing the FAIRness and quality of the learning materials.

| **Essential** | **Topic** | **Stage** | **FAIR aspect** | **Goal** | **CHECKLIST   QUESTION** |
|:---:|---|:---:|:---:|---|---|
|   | Instructional design process | Prepare | / | Learner-centric   learning resources | Did   you follow the stages of the backward instructional design process while   developing the learning resource? |

### Activity

Both the general and the FAIR-by-Design methodology QA checklists are made available as forms on the Skills4EOSC learning platform. Perform a QA self-check using the forms and analyse the obtained score.

![QA self-check links on the learning platform](./attachments/self-check_moodle.png)

Based on the results of the self-check QA analysis you should go back and make adjustments and re-publish again if needed.

## External QA

To truly view the produced learning materials through the lenses of learners and other instructors, you need to perform a QA check with the help of an external party. This external party should be someone who has not been involved in any step of the materials design, better yet has not seen the materials ever before. In this way, you will have a pair of fresh eyes that will review the learning materials without any cognitive bias.

To further support this effort the chosen QA reviewer should be an expert that is very well versed in the requirements for engaging learning content and learning styles, as well as the FAIR principles. It is their job as an external QA reviewer to evaluate the learning materials performance, quality, and suggest improvements using an objective and independent perspective.

The external QA reviewer can also use the T2.4 QA guidelines and checklists as a starting point for the QA, but should be encouraged to go more in depth with the review process. 

The high impact recommendations in the QA review report should be resolved as soon as possible. The lower level improvement recommendations can be taken into account as relevant input for the continuous improvement step.

### Learning platform QA

In addition to the checklists the external QA reviewer should also ensure that the course on the Skill4EOSC learning platform is working properly.

This must be done before the scheduled training (if the course is instructor-led) takes place. For these purposes the external QA reviewer should assume the role of a learner and try to:

- access the course information
- self-enroll in the course
- go through **all** of the resources available on the course
    - including quizzes, feedback form and any other type of interaction

Any identified problems should be resolved as soon as possible. 

## Feedback-based QA

![feedback icon on the learning platform](./attachments/feedback_moodle.png)

An integral part of the QA process is using the feedback form to evaluate the performance and identify areas of improvement for the developed learning materials. For these purposes the feedback gathered via the implemented feedback form should be regularly analysed and any comments and insights should be taken as input into the continuous improvement phase. 

## Summary

Performing a QA self-check after publication is an essential step that aims to ensure that all stages of the FAIR-by-Design methodology have been implemented successfully and the learning materials are accessible and presented as planned. 

The QA guidelines and checklists developed by T2.4 can be extremely helpful when it comes to QA.

By engaging an external QA reviewer you are demonstrating your commitment to producing high-quality learning materials and provide accountability to your learners, the instructors community and the public in general.

The suggested improvements by the QA reviewers together with the analysed feedback results are the input that triggers the activation of the continuous improvement step that aims to develop a new higher-quality version of the learning materials.
